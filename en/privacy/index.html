<p>We are very delighted that you have shown interest in our enterprise. Data protection is of a particularly high priority for the management of die PavingWays GmbH. The use of the Internet pages of die PavingWays GmbH is
  possible without any indication of personal data; however, if a data subject wants to use special enterprise services via our website, processing of personal data could become necessary. If the processing of personal data is necessary and
  there is no statutory basis for such processing, we generally obtain consent from the data subject.</p>
<p>The processing of personal data, such as the name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number of a data subject shall always be in line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and in accordance with the country-specific data
  protection regulations applicable to die PavingWays GmbH. By means of this data protection declaration, our enterprise would like to inform the general public of the nature, scope, and purpose of the personal data we collect, use
  and process. Furthermore, data subjects are informed, by means of this data protection declaration, of the rights to which they are entitled.</p>
<p>As the controller, die PavingWays GmbH has implemented numerous technical and organizational measures to ensure the most complete protection of personal data processed through this website. However, Internet-based data transmissions
  may in principle have security gaps, so absolute protection may not be guaranteed. For this reason, every data subject is free to transfer personal data to us via alternative means, e.g. by telephone.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Definitions
    The data protection declaration of die PavingWays GmbH is based on the terms used by the European legislator for the adoption of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Our data protection declaration should be legible
    and understandable for the general public, as well as our customers and business partners. To ensure this, we would like to first explain the terminology used.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>In this data protection declaration, we use, inter alia, the following terms:</p>
<p>a) Personal data
  Personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‚Äúdata subject‚Äù). An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier
  such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.</p>
<p>b) Data subject
  Data subject is any identified or identifiable natural person, whose personal data is processed by the controller responsible for the processing.</p>
<p>c) Processing
  Processing is any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration,
  retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction.</p>
<p>d) Restriction of processing
  Restriction of processing is the marking of stored personal data with the aim of limiting their processing in the future.</p>
<p>e) Profiling
  Profiling means any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural
  person's performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements.</p>
<p>f) Pseudonymisation
  Pseudonymisation is the processing of personal data in such a manner that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept
  separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that the personal data are not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person.</p>
<p>g) Controller or controller responsible for the processing
  Controller or controller responsible for the processing is the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where
  the purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law.</p>
<p>h) Processor
  Processor is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller.</p>
<p>i) Recipient
  Recipient is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or another body, to which the personal data are disclosed, whether a third party or not. However, public authorities which may receive personal data in the framework of a
  particular inquiry in accordance with Union or Member State law shall not be regarded as recipients; the processing of those data by those public authorities shall be in compliance with the applicable data protection rules according to the
  purposes of the processing.</p>
<p>j) Third party
  Third party is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or body other than the data subject, controller, processor and persons who, under the direct authority of the controller or processor, are authorised to process personal
  data.</p>
<p>k) Consent
  Consent of the data subject is any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of
  personal data relating to him or her.</p>
<ol>

  <li>Collection of general data and information
    The website of die PavingWays GmbH is hosted and delivered by Github.com. Github.com collects a series of general data and information when a data subject or automated system calls up the website. This general data and
    information are stored in the server log files. Collected may be (1) the browser types and versions used, (2) the operating system used by the accessing system, (3) the website from which an accessing system reaches our website (so-called
    referrers), (4) the sub-websites, (5) the date and time of access to the Internet site, (6) an Internet protocol address (IP address), (7) the Internet service provider of the accessing system, and (8) any other similar data and
    information that may be used in the event of attacks on our information technology systems.
  </li>
</ol>

  content of our website as well as its advertisement, (3) ensure the long-term viability of our information technology systems and website technology, and (4) provide law enforcement authorities with the information necessary for criminal
  prosecution in case of a cyber-attack. Therefore, die PavingWays GmbH analyzes anonymously collected data and information statistically, with the aim of increasing the data protection and data security of our enterprise, and to
  ensure an optimal level of protection for the personal data we process. The anonymous data of the server log files are stored separately from all personal data provided by a data subject.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Routine erasure and blocking of personal data

  </li>
</ol>
<p>b) Right of access
  Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller free information about his or her personal data stored at any time and a copy of this information. Furthermore, the European directives

  consequences of such processing for the data subject.
  Furthermore, the data subject shall have a right to obtain information as to whether personal data are transferred to a third country or to an international organisation. Where this is the case, the data subject shall have the right to be
  informed of the appropriate safeguards relating to the transfer.</p>

<p>d) Right to erasure (Right to be forgotten)
  Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data concerning him or her without undue delay, and the controller shall have the obligation to erase personal
  data without undue delay where one of the following grounds applies, as long as the processing is not necessary:</p>

An employee of PavingWays GmbH shall promptly ensure that the erasure request is complied with immediately.</p>
<p>Where the controller has made personal data public and is obliged pursuant to Article 17(1) to erase the personal data, the controller, taking account of available technology and the cost of implementation, shall take reasonable steps,
  including technical measures, to inform other controllers processing the personal data that the data subject has requested erasure by such controllers of any links to, or copy or replication of, those personal data, as far as processing is

  controller. The employee of die PavingWays GmbH will arrange the restriction of the processing.</p>

  <li>Data protection provisions about the application and use of LinkedIn
    The controller has integrated components of the LinkedIn Corporation on this website. LinkedIn is a web-based social network that enables users with existing business contacts to connect and to make new business contacts. Over 400 million
    registered people in more than 200 countries use LinkedIn. Thus, LinkedIn is currently the largest platform for business contacts and one of the most visited websites in the world.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>The operating company of LinkedIn is LinkedIn Corporation, 2029 Stierlin Court Mountain View, CA 94043, UNITED STATES. For privacy matters outside of the UNITED STATES LinkedIn Ireland, Privacy Policy Issues, Wilton Plaza, Wilton Place, Dublin
  2, Ireland, is responsible.</p>
<p>With each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet site, which is operated by the controller and on which a LinkedIn component (LinkedIn plug-in) was integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the
  data subject is automatically prompted to the download of a display of the corresponding LinkedIn component of LinkedIn. Further information about the LinkedIn plug-in may be accessed under https://developer.linkedin.com/plugins. During the
  course of this technical procedure, LinkedIn gains knowledge of what specific sub-page of our website was visited by the data subject.</p>
<p>If the data subject is logged in at the same time on LinkedIn, LinkedIn detects with every call-up to our website by the data subject‚Äîand for the entire duration of their stay on our Internet site‚Äîwhich specific sub-page of our Internet page
  was visited by the data subject. This information is collected through the LinkedIn component and associated with the respective LinkedIn account of the data subject. If the data subject clicks on one of the LinkedIn buttons integrated on our
  website, then LinkedIn assigns this information to the personal LinkedIn user account of the data subject and stores the personal data.</p>
<p>LinkedIn receives information via the LinkedIn component that the data subject has visited our website, provided that the data subject is logged in at LinkedIn at the time of the call-up to our website. This occurs regardless of whether the
  person clicks on the LinkedIn button or not. If such a transmission of information to LinkedIn is not desirable for the data subject, then he or she may prevent this by logging off from their LinkedIn account before a call-up to our website
  is made.</p>

<p>With each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet site, which is operated by the controller and on which a Twitter component (Twitter button) was integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the data
  subject is automatically prompted to download a display of the corresponding Twitter component of Twitter. Further information about the Twitter buttons is available under https://about.twitter.com/de/resources/buttons. During the course of
  this technical procedure, Twitter gains knowledge of what specific sub-page of our website was visited by the data subject. The purpose of the integration of the Twitter component is a retransmission of the contents of this website to allow
  our users to introduce this web page to the digital world and increase our visitor numbers.</p>
<p>If the data subject is logged in at the same time on Twitter, Twitter detects with every call-up to our website by the data subject and for the entire duration of their stay on our Internet site which specific sub-page of our Internet page was
  visited by the data subject. This information is collected through the Twitter component and associated with the respective Twitter account of the data subject. If the data subject clicks on one of the Twitter buttons integrated on our
  website, then Twitter assigns this information to the personal Twitter user account of the data subject and stores the personal data.</p>
<p>Twitter receives information via the Twitter component that the data subject has visited our website, provided that the data subject is logged in on Twitter at the time of the call-up to our website. This occurs regardless of whether the
  person clicks on the Twitter component or not. If such a transmission of information to Twitter is not desirable for the data subject, then he or she may prevent this by logging off from their Twitter account before a call-up to our website
  is made.</p>

<p>With each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet site, which is operated by the controller and on which a XING component (XING plug-in) was integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the data
  subject is automatically prompted to download a display of the corresponding XING component of XING. Further information about the XING plug-in the may be accessed under https://dev.xing.com/plugins. During the course of this technical
  procedure, XING gains knowledge of what specific sub-page of our website was visited by the data subject.</p>
<p>If the data subject is logged in at the same time on XING, XING detects with every call-up to our website by the data subject‚Äîand for the entire duration of their stay on our Internet site‚Äîwhich specific sub-page of our Internet page was
  visited by the data subject. This information is collected through the XING component and associated with the respective XING account of the data subject. If the data subject clicks on the XING button integrated on our Internet site, e.g. the
  "Share"-button, then XING assigns this information to the personal XING user account of the data subject and stores the personal data.</p>
<p>XING receives information via the XING component that the data subject has visited our website, provided that the data subject is logged in at XING at the time of the call to our website. This occurs regardless of whether the person clicks on
  the XING component or not. If such a transmission of information to XING is not desirable for the data subject, then he or she can prevent this by logging off from their XING account before a call-up to our website is made.</p>
<p>The data protection provisions published by XING, which is available under https://www.xing.com/privacy, provide information on the collection, processing and use of personal data by XING. In addition, XING has published privacy notices for
  the XING share button under https://www.xing.com/app/share?op=data_protection.</p>

  <li><p>Legal basis for the processing
    Art. 6(1) lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing operations for which we obtain consent for a specific processing purpose. If the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data
    subject is party, as is the case, for example, when processing operations are necessary for the supply of goods or to provide any other service, the processing is based on Article 6(1) lit. b GDPR. The same applies to such processing
    operations which are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of inquiries concerning our products or services. Is our company subject to a legal obligation by which processing of personal data is
    required, such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6(1) lit. c GDPR. In rare cases, the processing of personal data may be necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another
    natural person. This would be the case, for example, if a visitor were injured in our company and his name, age, health insurance data or other vital information would have to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other third party. Then
    the processing would be based on Art. 6(1) lit. d GDPR. Finally, processing operations could be based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR. This legal basis is used for processing operations which are not covered by any of the abovementioned legal
    grounds, if processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by our company or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data
    subject which require protection of personal data. Such processing operations are particularly permissible because they have been specifically mentioned by the European legislator. He considered that a legitimate interest could be assumed
    if the data subject is a client of the controller (Recital 47 Sentence 2 GDPR).</p></li>
  <li><p>The legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party
    Where the processing of personal data is based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR our legitimate interest is to carry out our business in favor of the well-being of all our employees and the shareholders.</p></li>
  <li><p>Period for which the personal data will be stored
    The criteria used to determine the period of storage of personal data is the respective statutory retention period. After expiration of that period, the corresponding data is routinely deleted, as long as it is no longer necessary for the
    fulfillment of the contract or the initiation of a contract.</p></li>
  <li><p>Provision of personal data as statutory or contractual requirement; Requirement necessary to enter into a contract; Obligation of the data subject to provide the personal data; possible consequences of failure to provide such data
    We clarify that the provision of personal data is partly required by law (e.g. tax regulations) or can also result from contractual provisions (e.g. information on the contractual partner). Sometimes it may be necessary to conclude a
    contract that the data subject provides us with personal data, which must subsequently be processed by us. The data subject is, for example, obliged to provide us with personal data when our company signs a contract with him or her. The
    non-provision of the personal data would have the consequence that the contract with the data subject could not be concluded. Before personal data is provided by the data subject, the data subject must contact any employee. The employee
    clarifies to the data subject whether the provision of the personal data is required by law or contract or is necessary for the conclusion of the contract, whether there is an obligation to provide the personal data and the consequences
    of non-provision of the personal data.</p></li>
  <li><p>Existence of automated decision-making
    As a responsible company, we do not use automatic decision-making or profiling.</p></li>
