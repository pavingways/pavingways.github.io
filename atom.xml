    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Vergangenen Mittwoch hatten wir nun unser zweites <a href="http://www.phonegap.com/" title="PhoneGap">PhoneGap</a> und HTML5 Meetup. Auf der Agenda standen zwei Präsentationen: <a href="http://www.meetup.com/PhoneGap-HTML5-Meetup-Rhein-Main/"></a>PhoneGap 1.0 und Remote Debugging, außerdem hat sich <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/wpbasti" title="@wpbasti">@wpbasti</a> spontan zu einem Intro zu <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_tool" title="Tooling">Tooling</a> im allgemeinen und <a href="https://github.com/wpbasti/jasy" title="Jasy">Jasy</a> im speziellen entschlossen.</p>

<p>Nachdem ich mein Intro zu PhoneGap 1.0 mit Ausblick auf 2.0 und eine kurze XCode Demo mit dem <a href="http://joapp.com/" title="Jo App-Framework">Jo App-Framework</a> beendet hatte, hat uns Martin <a href="http://phonegap.github.com/weinre/">Weinre</a> und Remote Debugging gezeigt. Er hat uns außerdem die Idee zu seiner anstehenden Bachelor-Arbeit präsentiert. Dabei geht es um die Entwicklung eines PhoneGap-Polyfills um die Entwicklung von Apps im Browser zu erleichtern. Die Idee kam gut an und mögliche Parallelen zum <a href="http://ripple.tinyhippos.com/">Ripple Emulator</a> wurden kurz besprochen. Martin hat außerdem vor, ein Meetup für Mobile-Entwickler in Mannheim zu starten.</p>

<p>Unser kleiner Bereich im <a href="http://www.sternstunde-ffm.de/">Sternstunde</a> war mit den 9 Teilnehmern, davon einige neue, ganz gut ausgelastet und es gab leckere arabische Tapas. Leider war es etwas lauter als erhofft, da parallel das Spiel Deutschland : Brasilien lief. Wir haben uns dennoch gut unterhalten und ich denke, es war für jeden etwas interessantes dabei.</p>

<p>Unser Teilnehmer <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/wltrd">Walter</a> hat uns noch darauf hingewiesen, dass er mit <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/ppk">@ppk</a> im September einen Mobilism-Workshop in Frankfurt organisiert. Der geplante Termin ist der 28. und 29. September 2011. Mehr Infos dazu gibt&rsquo;s auf der <a href="http://mobilism.nl/workshops/frankfurt-sept-2011">Mobilism Website</a>.</p>

<p>Das nächste Meetup folgt in ein paar Wochen und wird natürlich auch auf <a href="http://www.meetup.com/PhoneGap-HTML5-Meetup-Rhein-Main/">unserer Meetup.com Seite</a> bekannt gegeben &ndash; ich freue mich schon drauf!</p>

    <updated>2010-04-26T01:52:07+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://pavingways.github.io/html5css3-meetup-april-recap_1647</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It has been a few days ago, but I still wanted to provide a little recap of our last HTML5/CSS3 meetup. We were set up for eight people this time but only had a turnout of five. It was still a nice evening at
<a href="http://www.frollein-restaurant.de">Frollein in Sachsenhausen</a>. Additional to great food there was some HTML5 with <a href="http://www.modernizr.com">Modernizr</a> presented by <a href="http://twitter.com/jesseberlin">Jesse</a> and a lot of <a href="http://nodejs.org">Node.js</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.modernizr.com">Modernizr</a> is a tool you can use as a fallback mechanism for new HTML5 pages. You include the JavaScript file in your HTML5 page and it detects the browser&rsquo;s compatibility for all sorts of new features. The tool adds classes for each supported HTML5 attribute to the document&rsquo;s body so you can take care of these document parts with special CSS classes. Modernizr also creates a special JavaScript object to do things like:</p>

<pre><code>if (Modernizr.geolocation){ ...do geolocation stuff ... }
</code></pre>

<p>&hellip; kinda neat. It would be great to have this as a jQuery plugin or even better within the <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.support">jQuery.support</a> feature. Both <a href="http://twitter.com/kompozer">Andreas</a> and myself had prepared a WebSocket demo. My demo did not work, Andreas&#8217; did, at least halfway&hellip;
There was incoming data from <a href="http://apiwiki.twitter.com/Streaming-API-Documentation">Twitter&rsquo;s brand new streaming API</a> to Node.js. The WebSocket connection to Chrome did not really want to work completely that evening, but we could see #fail-tagged tweets streaming in on the console :) I can not really recall the context, but there were also talking about <a href="http://code.stanziq.com/strophe/">Strophe</a>, a JavaScript XMPP library framework well worth looking into.
<strike>I don&rsquo;t have access to Andreas&#8217; presentation</strike> (see below), but I also created one, so here&rsquo;s another introduction to Node.js:</p>

<p>We were thinking of getting a small HTML5/CSS3 project going within the meetup group, so everybody has something to work on until the next meetup &ndash; I still think this is a good idea, now if I could just come up with something useful&hellip;</p>

<p>The next meetup will be around the end of May, stay tuned!</p>

<p>UPDATE: Andreas provided Links to his slides and the project itself, it&rsquo;s called <a href="http://github.com/kompozer/tweamer"><strong>tweamer</strong> and it is available on GitHub</a>. Here are the slides:</p>

    <id>http://pavingways.github.io/nodejs-node-is-important-introduction_1618</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Once in a while you come across a new technology and are just blown away by it. You feel that something like this should have been around much earlier and that it is (gonna be) a significant milestone, not just in your own live as a developer but in general. The last time this happened to me was when I dug a bit deeper into a project called <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a> or just &ldquo;node&rdquo; as the binary is called. In case you have not heard about this don&rsquo;t worry. However, if you are a developer, especially if you are working with JavaScript, then you should be concerned and maybe check your news sources, because it is a couple of months old already and it is drawing a lot of attention lately! If you&rsquo;re not a developer this might get a bit techy from here, but maybe you get something out of it after all&hellip;</p>

<h3>What is node.js?</h3>

<p> It&rsquo;s actually not too easy to explain, but basically node.js is an:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>open-source</p></li>
<li><p>low-level</p></li>
<li><p>evented</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_I/O">non-blocking</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_loop">event loop</a> based</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-side_JavaScript">SSJS</a> runtime environment</p></li>
</ul>


<p> It is written in C and JavaScript, it contains the</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_(JavaScript_engine)">V8 JavaScript engine</a>, a <a href="http://commonjs.org/">CommonJS</a> module system and it helps you to implement highly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(computer_science)">concurrent web servers</a> by handling I/O very efficiently, namely in a <a href="http://www.kegel.com/dkftpbench/nonblocking.html">non-blocking</a> way. Support for TCP, DNS and HTTP is included and many HTTP features are supported that are important for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_(programming)">Comet</a>-style web applications &ndash; things like hanging requests. Node.js itself is a program that will have to be compiled and installed on your machine. Then you can use JavaScript to write programs that use the API of node.js and that are executed through the node binary as simple as this: &ldquo;node yourprogram.js&rdquo;. Due to the included V8 you have the complete JavaScript API available, it&rsquo;s just that you are not running your JavaScript program inside of a browser context, but as a program within the node.js environment. Node extends the JS API by several things like access to the file system and such. All of this is what <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-side_JavaScript">server-side JavaScript</a> is all about.</p>

<h3>What is Special about node.js?</h3>

<p> There are other implementations for this kind of stuff, but what <a href="http://tinyclouds.org/">Ryan Dahl</a> <a href="http://github.com/ry/node">et al</a> do differently with node.js is to use <strong>JavaScript</strong> as the main programming language and the strict paradigm of exclusively working with callbacks and<strong> non-blocking I/O</strong>. This means that basically any function you are executing in a node.js program does work in the background after calling, executing a <strong>callback function</strong> once it is done. This enables the program itself to continue and not to block any resources while it is waiting for the function to finish whatever it does.</p>

<h3>A Practical Example: The Web Server</h3>

<p> Ok, this is a bit dry and mind-bending maybe, but it all makes a lot of sense: Think about <a href="http://www.kegel.com/c10k.html">thousands of internet users entering the URL of your website</a> causing their web browsers to hit your web server at the same time (maybe they fire Ajax requests too). Each of these requests would cause a <strong>thread</strong> in your regular web server (= Apache) to spawn that executes a script (PHP maybe) which does DB queries and such before finally returning the response to the browser. Here we have 2 things to look at: memory usage and blocking I/O. Each of these threads uses memory. Many threads use a lot of memory. Thousands of users would cause thousands of threads to use a lot of memory&hellip;you see where this is going&hellip;you will run out of memory soon and your page or service will not respond anymore. Blocking I/O is the cause for that problem: each one of these threads does things like DB access which takes some time to finish. This is normal because the DB tables might be huge and queries might take long to find the result you are looking for. Now the script on your web server would usually execute a DB query, <strong>then wait until it gets a result</strong> from the DB server and then continue. While the DB server fetches your data your whole script is blocked. It does not continue to run until the result has come back and it is using memory and other resources while waiting. If this happens <strong>several thousand times at once </strong>this blocks a lot of resources and your server goes into a memory dry spell. If it would be possible to get rid of all these threads and to put them all into a big pool this would solve some memory issues. If it on top of that would be possible to continue doing other tasks while waiting for DB queries this would surely help performance to increase &ndash; and that&rsquo;s what node.js does.</p>

<h3>Event Loop to the Rescue</h3>

<p> A node-based server will pool all incoming connections and the underlying node framework can do things like <strong>hanging these connections</strong> to a &ldquo;waiting&rdquo; state while allowing the server to continue working on creating the response. The <strong>event loop and the callback paradigm</strong> in node.js is used to execute a DB query, but not wait for a response blocking a lot of resources. Rather a callback is attached to the DB result and node.js goes on with other tasks (saving CPU cycles). For the browser on the other side this results simply in a &ldquo;waiting for response&rdquo; situation, same as for the threaded server. So, whenever the result from the DB comes back, node.js is executing whatever callback function was attached to the querying function and once the request is ready it will get the related connection from the pool, end its &ldquo;waiting&rdquo; state and return it to the browser. This is causing way less memory usage and allows for much faster response times. This is just a tiny bit of the whole story, so make sure you <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/four.livejournal/20091117/jsconf.pdf">get into</a> this!</p>

<h3>But Why is this Important?</h3>

<p> Well, Ajax and Comet-driven web applications are generating heavy load on web servers, especially if you look at chat applications or multiplayer browser games where there are <strong>many concurrent connections</strong> and small response times are essential. Here lays the strength of node.js. In the past to me it felt like we had reached a time where the traditional way to implement our web servers would not fit to the demands that we had on the client-side during the last months. <a href="http://cometdaily.com/2007/12/11/the-future-of-comet-part-1-comet-today/">Comet and Ajax-Push is a big hack</a>, <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/websockets/">HTML5 Web Sockets</a> are knocking at our door and we want to do things like <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=data+streaming+realtime+web">real time data streaming</a>. Node.js can fill this need. Sure, it takes some time of getting used to for developers that have been working with &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; Ajax paradigms for the past years. It also seems like we would walk into a time where regular websites and Ajax driven web applications would get their own servers. But it surely feels like we would finally have a toolkit which solves many of our newly developed needs and which brings the web as a whole a big step further. It might well be the best thing since sliced bread. On top of that it is now possible to write a simple web server and basically all the server side logic in JavaScript, which is great if you are working with JavaScript on the client side as well. To close this I can just encourage anybody working with Ajax or Comet or even just JavaScript in any way <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/four.livejournal/20091117/jsconf.pdf">to look into node.js</a> &ndash; it helped me to understand web server issues in more detail and I will be working with this and see where it goes. As it seems some <a href="http://wiki.github.com/ry/node/">others are working with this already too</a> and even Simon Willison <a href="http://simonwillison.net/2009/Nov/23/node/">was excited</a> after Ryan Dahl gave a good introduction to node.js at <a href="http://jsconf.eu/2009/">last year&rsquo;s JSConf</a>:</p>

    <id>http://pavingways.github.io/mobile-widgets-the-ubiquitous-mobile-web_84</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
      <img src="http://www.pavingways.com/wp-content/uploads/nokia_widgets.JPG" alt="Nokia Mobile Widgets" title="Nokia Mobile Widgets" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right" />On <a href="http://www.nokia.com/A4136001?newsid=1118790" title="Nokia Press Release about Mobile Widgets"><span>April 16, 2007</span> Nokia announced</a> their S60 platform would support widgets in subsequent releases. This means, using their WebKit based browser under the hood, newer phones (S60 3rd ed. with Feature Pack 2) will have support for those small applications, mostly serving not more than a single purpose (e.g. show the weather or an RSS feed) that are well known on the desktop since a couple of years now.
    </p>


<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;In preparation to &lt;a href="http://2007.xtech.org/public/schedule/detail/150"&gt;my talk at this year's XTech conference&lt;/a&gt; I want to point out some important things related to this announcement. I think widgets on (mobile) devices are a major step in the right direction and I feel the mobile web can finally get the boost it so desperately was waiting for since a couple of years now. "The Ubiquitous Web" is this year's XTech topic - I feel the mobile web will become ubiquitous pretty soon...This article can be seen as a primer to my talk at XTech: &lt;a href="http://2007.xtech.org/public/schedule/detail/150"&gt;Ajax on mobile devices - making mobile web apps ubiquitous&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;!--more--&gt;The Nokia announcement is nothing new, but still it is an important announcement, because it is yet another vendor of a phone browser to announce not only support for Ajax but also for widgets. In the case of Nokia it's even a phone and platform manufacturer.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src="http://www.pavingways.com/wp-content/uploads/opera_platform_early_screen.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Opera Platform Early Screenshot" title="Opera Platform" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right" /&gt;Other browser vendors have done this before. The first one to implement a working mobile widget engine was &lt;a href="http://www.opera.com/"&gt;Opera&lt;/a&gt; back in October 2004, it was called &lt;a href="http://www.opera.com/products/mobile/platform/"&gt;Opera Platform&lt;/a&gt;. While the Opera Platform was hard to install and more or less a proof-of-concept approach, Opera 9 for mobile, the browser that is soon to be released, also features widgets and comes pre-installed in many devices. New versions of the &lt;a href="http://www.access-company.com/products/netfrontmobile/browser/index.html"&gt;Netfront browser&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.openwave.com/us/products/handset_products/mobile_widgets/"&gt;OpenWave MIDAS project&lt;/a&gt; are announced to feature support not only for Ajax, but also for widgets. This shows that all major browser vendors in the mobile area have (finally) realized the importance of Ajax and widget support (hint: critical mass).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  What about Apple's iPhone? Nobody has really seen it yet, but as it looks, it will not only feature Ajax powered widgets, but widgets will be the iPhone's main (only?) way to add applications to the device. The iPhone probably also can be seen as one of the driving forces behind the motivation in browser vendor's announcements and developments.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;What is the technical background?&lt;/strong&gt; Widgets are little applications typically created using existing web technologies, such as XHTML, CSS and JavaScript (yes, this means Ajax to a big extend). Nokia calls their widget environment "Web Run-Time" and, as already mentioned, this environment essentially means the already existing web browser on the device. However in contrast to the browser a widget is not loaded by typing in a URL into the browser, but it is a web application that is installed directly on the phone, so all the images, CSS files and JavaScript code is already on the phone and can therefore be much bigger than if it would have to be loaded through a 3G or GPRS network connection.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  Another very important aspect of the Web Run-Time environment and basically any widget environment is that the run-time environment can do things a regular web browser was not able to do before: widgets can get access to the device API and consequently can interface to the phone hardware such as GPS or camera and other applications like the calendar or contact manager.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Why is this important?&lt;/strong&gt; XHTML/CSS/JavaScript and Ajax are well known standards and technologies amongst a large web developer community. Those technologies are powering the most successful applications and services on the web. For those services it was hard to implement mobile verisons of their services for mobile devices. The support for web-standards based widgets on mobile phones is a huge step forward to a world where every web developer can be able to create an application for a mobile phone and where those web applications that are successful on the desktop can also be successful on mobile devices.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  Furthermore widgets can do more by accessing a device's hardware and applications and are therefore way more valuable to the user than a regular web application. Imagine a widget that can be used to make a picture and store it to your flickr account: it would start your camera, grab the picture you take, add location tags automatically (if your phone has GPS) and asynchronously upload the picture to flickr while you're already doing something else like reading the latest RSS feed in your news widget.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  But maybe the most important aspect of this is that the underlying technologies - XHTML/CSS/JS/Ajax - are universally used across all those different widget engines and run-times. The develop-once-deploy-to-many vision appears again... Mobile widgets could emerge as a major player against Java ME applications in many areas. Still it has to be kept in mind that the same way as browser implementations of those technologies differ from one to the other it will be the same with widget engines. It cannot be expected that a widget, once created, will run in different widget engines without modifications or even complete rewriting. Most probably the widget engines will also employ different means to wrap the widget application in a deployable package, using ZIP containers will probably be only one of the methods.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;What role does Ajax play here?&lt;/strong&gt; Ajax will, as well as the other open standards-based technologies, play a major role in the widget creator's toolbox. While XHTML and CSS will handle structure and presentation, JavaScript will act as the business logic layer and Ajax will provide the means to communicate asynchronously with remote servers and web services of different kinds.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;How this makes the web ubiquitous?&lt;/strong&gt; A phone that comes pre-installed with your favorite web applications (read "widgets") needs very little data transmissions to get live data from the web (read "Ajax"). Therefore widgets, powered by Ajax will be able to provide phone users with useful applications, that can connect to web services and other applications on phones of other users. If developing widgets for mobile phones will be as easy as anticipated above, these widgets will be able to do what regular browsers on mobile devices have been trying to achieve in quite some years until now: make people actually use the mobile web! Since the Ajax requests can happen asynchronously and in the background the user of the application doesn't even need to know that the "web" is being accessed right now. The mobile web will become ubiquitous and invisible at the same time - ok, concededly this is a very philosophical view - but maybe not even too far away from the future reality.
&lt;/p&gt;

      In <a href="http://www.pavingways.com/xml-2006-conference-boston-co-speaking_68.html">my presentation</a> at the <a href="http://2006.xmlconference.org/">XML 2006 conference in Boston </a>I tried to show that AJAX - as a technology in part based on XML - is a useful and promising tool to create web applications on mobile devices.
    </p>


<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;
  To emphasize this, I updated our &lt;a href="http://pwmwa.com/gc/"&gt;event finder application&lt;/a&gt; that we had used on this year's &lt;a href="http://www.gc-germany.com/"&gt;Games Convention&lt;/a&gt; in Leipzig, Germany. The application basically is a website for mobile phones that shows the currently running events of a trade show or conference. In the &lt;a href="http://www.pwmwa.com/xml06/"&gt;updated version for the XML 2006 conference&lt;/a&gt; I added some AJAX stuff to show and test it's usefulness:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;!--more--&gt; If you open the URL (

  &lt;a href="http://www.pwmwa.com/xml06/"&gt;http://www.pwmwa.com/xml06/&lt;/a&gt;) you will get a list of all events currently running and those coming up during the next 24 hours. Every event in this list contains a link that points to a page with detailed information about the event. Using JavaScript this link is captured and an XHR call is made to retrieve the details of the event ad show them directly on the list, saving a lot of unnecessary page reloads and making the page (theoretically) work on different devices. Below the details of the event users can leave comments, which are also added to the list using XHR.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  Summarized, users load a list of events once and then load additional information to some events and post information to some others - always only loading the necessary parts of the page.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  One main point in my presentation was that cross-platform Mobile AJAX really is possible, because already many mobile web browsers support the XMLHttpRequest. For those that do not support it, the application needs to provide fall-backs, so it works without XHR as well. The event finder demo accordingly works on different mobile browsers: Pocket IE (IE Mobile), Opera Mobile (not Mini) and even Minimo make use of the AJAX capabilities, while other browsers, such as Opera Mini still work and just reload the whole page everytime you click somewhere.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  Speaking of support it became pretty clear that the phone at least needs to support XHTML ad CSS (WAP 2.0) correctly in order to use the application (which is XHTML-MP). A short test on a Nokia N80 quickly assured me that this phone's integrated browser has it's difficulties with the table-less CSS layout.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  The event finder really does AJAH, not AJAX - loading HTML parts instead of pure XML data - out of reasons I also explained in my presentation: with mobile AJAX you have to deal with a trade-off between small traffic and device capabilities. This means if you transfer pure XML with an XHR call, the traffic might be smaller compared to transferring HTML, but if you only receive XML data on the client you need to do a lot more post-processing (DOM scripting) in order to produce the desired output, which equals the HTML. To do this, the client (mobile phone browser) needs capabilities to do that (JavaScript implementation). Also the client uses more CPU and thus battery power, resulting in a shorter and probably slower overall experience. Therefore I currently see AJAH as the best solution for this type of problem.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  If you want, check out the mobile &lt;a href="http://www.pwmwa.com/xml06/"&gt;event finder application for the XML 2006 conference&lt;/a&gt; right &lt;a href="http://www.pwmwa.com/xml06/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (best using your phone) - and tell me about it! Does XHR work on your device? Does the page show correctly (compare to mozilla output)? etc...
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  Thanks to Dave for putting the link to the application on the XML 2006 conference website!
&lt;/p&gt;

    <link href="http://pavingways.github.io/mobile2event-review_59.html"/>
    <updated>2006-11-09T10:35:01+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://pavingways.github.io/mobile2event-review_59</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We kicked off our stay in San Francisco and the Silicon Valley with the <a href="http://www.mobile2event.com/">Mobile 2.0 event</a> organized by the folks that normally organize the Mobile Monday here in the Bay Area. There were around 300 people attending, the location was great as was the lunch and the free drinks afterwards. So what does Mobile 2.0 stand for? As Dan Appelquist described it, the concept or the idea behind this term is: &ldquo;mobile web connected apps on the mobile platform&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The whole event, apart from the keynotes, was held in panel discussions with panelists also taking some time for presenting on their own. The most interesting topics for us obviously was everything related to the mobile web and to browser based applications of which there were not many to be seen. The highlights were the presentations and demos of:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.soonr.com">SoonR</a>: nice AJAX job on the Opera Browser for mobile devices</li>
<li>Mobile Launchpad: Peter Vesterbacka and his many companies, especially <a href="http://www.3jam.com">3jam.com</a> with their brand new REST API for sending out SMS to many people at once</li>
<li>Arun Ranganathan of AOL: he pointed out some interesting basic principles like using <a href="http://wurfl.sourceforge.net/">WURFL</a> for detecting browsers and the need for an API to access phone features from within JavaScript in the mobile browser (as side information while speaking about his real topic)</li>
<li>dotMobi: Ronan Cremin presented the brand new validation tool, their Mobile Ready Report generator (nice!) and the developer section under <a href="http://dev.mobi"><a href="http://dev.mobi">http://dev.mobi</a></a> (thanks for the T-Shirt)</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>What have we learned?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>there are not so many relevant mobile browsers as initially thought (OpenWave, Access Netfront, Opera +mini, IE, minimo, S60 should cover > 95% of all devices)</li>
<li>some SonyEricsson phones use the Netfront browser</li>
<li>apparently many people call the &ldquo;Pocket IE&rdquo; (or &ldquo;IEMobile&rdquo;) &ldquo;Compact IE&rdquo;</li>
<li>battery life can be heavily decreased if there are AJAX applications running (need to test this)</li>
<li>carriers can be a pain and they also slow down browser and phone hardware development (many phones would have much more features if carriers would allow them to)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.funambol.com/opensource/phonesniperprogram.html">funambol.com pays you 25 bucks</a> if you contribute a test on your mobile phone to them</li>
<li>instant messaging on phones is all over the place and there will surely be some application to be seen in the mobile web area pretty soon</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>What did we get confirmed?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>the easier an application on a mobile is, the better</li>
<li>SMS is still important and will continue to be, also in the mobile web</li>
<li>browser capability detection is important (<a href="http://wurfl.sourceforge.net/">WURFL</a>)</li>
<li>mobile AJAX powered services will replace installable applications somewhen</li>
<li>people will use the mobile web heavily only if there is a real killer application (or some of them)</li>
<li>the future is browser based, not installed</li>
<li>the big thing that is still missing is the access to the mobile phone&rsquo;s features from within the browser (like a Javascript API to access the GPS module or the contact and calendar info on the phone)</li>
<li>making stuff work in many different browsers means making it degrade gracefully and bulletproof</li>
</ul>


<p>Special thanks go out to Tony Fish for signing my copy of</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mobile-Web-2-0-Innovators-Applications/dp/0954432762/sr=8-1/qid=1163058207/ref=sr_1_1/102-8312733-7552968?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books">his book</a> and to Michael from Opera, Rick and Yong from Access (Palmsource) for being such good discussion partners and for making this event even better with their questions and remarks on the mobile browser landscape ;). Also thanks to all the guys from Opera who joined us in the free beer extermination after the event and who also were amazing discussion partners.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s hope there will be many more of these events!</p>

<p>PS: Also check out <a href="http://opengardensblog.futuretext.com/archives/2006/11/mobile20_great.html">Paddy Byers extensive summary about the event on the Open Gardens Blog</a>! And thanks Paddy for our nice chat after the event and good luck to you for the next couple of months.</p>

<p>PPS: Also <a href="http://www.thisismobility.com/blog/?p=225">check out the comments of Mike Rowehl</a>, one of the organizers of the event, who was not quite happy with his own event. I think I have to disagree with him that Mobile 2.0 &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t quite do it&rdquo;, because at least for me it was quite a good experience.</p>

<p>PPPS: <a href="http://rafer.wirelessink.com/?p=63">Scott Rafer also seems to have found this event to be under par</a> &ndash; check out his comments on it here. Btw. the comment from the audience about the &ldquo;hiding&rdquo; of the user agent in Opera Mini caused quite a discussion at our table between Mike from Opera, me and Rick and Yong from Access (Netfront Browser).</p>

<p>PPPPS: <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/understanding_mobile_2.php">Rudy De Waele on Richard MacManus&#8217; weblog Read/WriteWeb</a> shares some interesting views about what Mobile 2.0 is and what companies are there at the moment. He also included a list of &ldquo;Recommended mobile 2.0 reading&rdquo; (we&rsquo;re not in it).</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
    <a href="http://www.mobile2event.com/"><img align="left" alt="Mobile 2.0 Event in San Francisco" id="image57" src="http://www.pavingways.com/wp-content/uploads/logo.png" /></a>The PavingWays team, will take part in a hot event that will take place in San Francisco on November 6, 2006. The &#8220;mobile2.0 conference&#8221; is a one-day event organized and hosted by Daniel Appelquist (<a href="http://mobilemonday.org.uk/">Mobile Monday London</a>), Mike Rowehl (<a href="http://www.mobilemonday.us/">Mobile Monday Silicon Valley</a>) and Gregory Gorman (<a href="http://www.opengroup.org/">The Open Group</a>).
  </p>


<p>  <p></p>

<pre><code>We actually planned to be in San Francisco from the middle of November, but re-scheduled because of this event. &lt;a href="http://logopoeia.com/about/"&gt;Michael(tm) Smith&lt;/a&gt; form Opera will also be there - I met him at this year's &lt;a href="http://xtech06.usefulinc.com/"&gt;Xtech conference in Amsterdam&lt;/a&gt; where I presented the CarCulatr - our first mobile AJAX web application based on the &lt;a href="http://www.opera.com/products/mobile/platform/"&gt;Opera Platform&lt;/a&gt;.
</code></pre>

<p>  </p></p>

<p>  <p></p>

<pre><code>We're eager to meet as many people as possible from the mobile web industry, for example Tony Fish, since we recently purchased his &lt;a href="http://www.mobileweb20.futuretext.com/"&gt;book on "Mobile Web 2.0"&lt;/a&gt; (written with &lt;a href="http://www.pavingways.com/Ajit%20Jaokar"&gt;Ajit Jaokar&lt;/a&gt;) we purchased recently.
</code></pre>

<p>  </p></p>

<p>  <p></p>

<pre><code>Please get in touch with us, if you wanna meet up during or after the conference - we'll be in San Francisco until early December. After that we will head towards Boston where I will attend this year's &lt;a href="http://2006.xmlconference.org/"&gt;XML Conference&lt;/a&gt; - this time as co speaker, but more on that later on.

    <link href="http://pavingways.github.io/detecting-mobile-browsers-mobile-intenet-explorer_56.html"/>
    <updated>2006-10-27T16:57:52+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://pavingways.github.io/detecting-mobile-browsers-mobile-intenet-explorer_56</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A little while ago <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/iemobile/default.aspx" title="Team IEMobile">Team IEMobile</a> posted an interesting article on <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/iemobile/default.aspx" title="Team IEMobile Blog">their blog</a> about changes in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent#Browsers">User-Agent string</a> that is sent to the web server when the browser requests a document. The browser of the Windows Mobile OS will undergo a rather radical change concerning this browser identification string that is often used by web developers to detect the browser in order to take advantage of it&rsquo;s unique features. Unfortunately the schema of the User-Agent string was not clear to many website creators in the past. Even the MSN website had problems of detecting the mobile IE correctly.</p>

<p>The browser of current and older Windows Mobile versions sends two different User-Agent strings, depending on what platform the OS runs on:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 4.01; Windows CE; PPC; 240x320)</p></li>
<li><p>Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 4.01; Windows CE; Smartphone; 176x220)</p></li>
</ul>


<p> Unfortunately the User-Agent string may or may not contain certain parts, for example the resolution information or even the &ldquo;MSIE 4.01&rdquo;. Therefore the only sure shot you can have at detecting the older and current Mobile Internet Explorers correctly is by detecting both &#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Smartphone</strong>&ldquo; or &rdquo;<strong>PPC</strong>&ldquo; and &rdquo;<strong>Windows CE</strong>&ldquo;.</p>

<p>However this will change with the new version of the browser that comes out on new devices sporting the Windows Mobile 5.0 OS. For new devices the IE Mobile User-Agent string will look like this:</p>

<!--more-->


<ul>
<li>Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows CE; IEMobile m.n) XYZ</li>
</ul>


<p> The &ldquo;m.n&rdquo; is a version number and it can differ from release to release. Thus it can also be used to take advantage of new features of every release. &ldquo;XYZ&rdquo; can be added by OEMs and it can basically include anything the OEM wants it to contain. Team IEMobile recommends to look for &#8221;</p>

<p><strong>IEMobile</strong>&ldquo; in the User-Agent string to be sure to detect the browser correctly, since this part will never change. It is also not necessary to make a distinction between smartphone and ppc versions anymore &ndash; both browsers are built from the same code base and have identical features.</p>

<p>So how do you get info about e.g the resolution of the device? That&rsquo;s what additional headers are there for &ndash; and not the User-Agent string! The browser sends additional UA headers to the server upon requesting document that contain information screen size, color depth, operating system, CPU type (not always on smartphones) and VoIP features (new) of the device. Those headers &ndash; that by the way are there at least since Windows Mobile 2002 &ndash; look like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>UA-pixels: {i.e. 240x320}</li>
<li>UA-color: {mono2 | mono4 | color8 | color16 | color24 | color32}</li>
<li>UA-OS: {Windows CE (POCKET PC) &ndash; Version 3.0}</li>
<li>UA-CPU = {i.e. ARM SA1110}</li>
<li>UA-Voice = {TRUE | FALSE}</li>
</ul>


<p>(<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/wcepie/html/ceconidentifyingpocketinternetexplorertowebserver.asp">here is some more info about UA headers and IIS</a>)</p>

<p>Another nice feature of the new IEMobile is a special meta tag that can be used to tell the browser to ignore the user display setting, turn off all layout optimizations and force the browser to render a page in &ldquo;desktop&rdquo; mode:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;meta name="MobileOptimized" content="width"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>(<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/mobilesdk5/html/wce51conLayoutMetaTag.asp">read more about this here&hellip;</a>)</p>

<p>Unfortunately Team IEMobile did not mention what new features we can expect from new browser versions. Especially CSS and JavaScript/XHR support would have been very interesting topics. But the post provides some very important information about how to be sure to detect the right browser version and even how to get additional information about the device the browser runs on.</p>

    <updated>2006-09-20T17:06:50+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://pavingways.github.io/pocket-web-from-11-first-affordable-mobile-flatrate-in-germany_54</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today we received an interesting newsletter from 1&amp;1 Internet AG, a German ISP. 1&amp;1 now offers a <strong>Pocket Web Flat</strong> for <strong>9.99 EUR per month</strong> (powered by Vodafone). There are no time or volume limitations and no additional basic fee, the offer is valid until 30 September 2006.</p>

<p>The service comes with a mobile handset that lacks the ability to make regular phonecalls, except if you are using a bluetooth headset (and pay from 0.29 EUR/Minute) and can therefore be best described as a PDA with phone abilities. However it supports push E-Mail and sports a webbrowser which is &ldquo;optimized for the mobile internet&rdquo;. It also has a calendar and a contact manager installed. There are no further information available about the platform or the software, so we will probably have to buy one of these to get more info.</p>

<p>Probably this whole offer is Vodafone&rsquo;s way to get real-life data about people using the mobile internet and to figure out if they could offer a mobile flatrate within their own data plans. At the moment what you get from Vodafone for 9.95 a month is 30MB and that&rsquo;s not a lot and quite a difference to a real flatrate or other offers &ndash; BASE offers a mobile flatrate for 25.00 EUR / month, but only if you are a BASE customer which makes another 25.00 EUR / month for the voice service (also flat).</p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s hope the test works well and we&rsquo;ll see the mobile flatrate available as regular data plans soon.

    <id>http://pavingways.github.io/the-market-for-mobile-services-status-quo_49</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is the current level of usage and consumer interest for data services?</strong></p>

<p><strong>What is important to consumers, both for mobile and voice services?</strong></p>

<p><strong>What implications can be drawn from usage differences between segments, geographies or even between the distinct customer bases of operators and device manufacturers?</strong></p>

<p>These questions were examined in the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.atkearney.com/main.taf?p=5,3,1,121,1"><strong>2005 A.T.Kearney Mobinet study</strong></a>, which is an assessment of global consumer trends in mobile usage. By interviewing mobile users in 21 countries the company researched the degree to which consumers are adopting mobile data services.</p>

<p><strong>Mobile phones &ndash; only for making phone calls?</strong></p>

<p>Nearly 60% of the customers expect to use their mobile phone to make the majority of their calls over the next year. Only 4% of consumers expect to use VoIP for the majority of their calls next year. Alarmingly a significant number of consumers are not convinced that their mobile operator should offer anything more than basic voice service. The majority (80%) of the 65-year olds (or older) reject data services compared to 25% of the under 24-year olds. Probably one reason for this is, that older people are more afraid of new technologies/services. Another important aspect is the price. 70% of mobile phone users see the price as the primary factor in choosing operator.</p>

<p><strong>What is the current level of usage and consumer interest for data services?</strong></p>

<p>Because the penetration of data-enabled, multimedia phones has increased to 53%, more consumers across all age groups are adopting mobile data services. Most of them (56%) use it<!--more--></p>

<ul>
<li><p>to browse their operator&rsquo;s portal,</p></li>
<li><p>to browse the internet,</p></li>
<li><p>to access mobile email,</p></li>
<li><p>to download music,</p></li>
<li><p>to stream music.</p></li>
</ul>


<p> But many customers still use their mobile device simply to make voice calls. Although music downloads and email are beginning to make a noticeable contribution, services, such as streaming videos, have still not generated meaningful revenues.</p>

<p>The study points out that the growing penetration of new multimedia phones is the catalyst, why consumers are able to access multimedia services via their device. Also impressive is the fact that more than half of the handsets are less than one year old. As figure 1 below shows, there is a clear relationship between the average revenue per user (APRU) and the age of the phone the customer uses. People who have recently replaced their mobile phones are more likely to be heavier user of data services.</p>

<p><strong>Development of Communication and Entertainment Services</strong></p>

<p>Mobile Internet and email use has grown dramatically across Western Europe and America. 56% of all multimedia phone owners have browsed the operator portal (e.g. Vodafone live!) or have used email at least once a month. Although SMS is still an important service<strong>, </strong>MMS, email or live video calling have grown steadily across most regions, even though they are in their early stages.</p>

<p>Entertainment services still lag behind communication, but younger consumer are eager for both music and gaming services. Today, 33% of them with multimedia phones download music (see figure 2). Gaming has also grown in Japan, America and Scandinavia, but levels of repeat use so far remain lower.</p>

<p>As figure 3 shows mobile TV is attractive to one-sixth of users especially between 18 &ndash; 44-year olds in Latin America, Asia and Eastern Europe. But they prefer TV content such as news and sports rather than entertainment programs.</p>

<p><strong>Capturing the value from mobile data</strong></p>

<p>To convert consumer interest into revenue has been a challenge for the past few years. One main reason was the difficulty navigating through the services on the phones. But this problem is solved. Two-thirds of users say that new services and functions are easy to use. Today, they are more concerned about the cost of mobile data (see figure 4). An important fact is that they are not willing to pay more than $5 a month for it.</p>

<p><img width="450" id="image53" alt="Mobinet 2005_Figure 4" src="http://www.pavingways.com/wp-content/uploads/Mobinet2005_figure4.gif" /></p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>

<p>The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.atkearney.com/main.taf?p=5,3,1,121,1"><strong>2005 A.T.Kearney Mobinet study</strong></a> gives us an interesting overview about the today&rsquo;s mobile industry. Indeed, many customers continue to use their mobile phones primarily to make voice calls, but more and more users are adopting multimedia services. As the study points out it is still a marketing issue to change that. It is necessary to develop adequate marketing strategies for new data services (e.g. through pricing packages or improved user experience), because marketing significantly lags technology development. And without forcing new marketing models most of the market remains focused on purchasing basic voice services at lowest price possible.</p>

<p>After all a market for mobile services exist but needs to be market to the customers.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Jeff Barr of Amazon has just finished his talk about all the APIs and web services of Amazon and Alexa. That means d.construct 2006 has officially started.</p>

<p>For those who saw Jeff&rsquo;s presentations at e.g. Xtech earlier this year, there was not much new stuff to be heard, except maybe the <a href="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonEC2/dg/2006-06-26/">EC2 service</a> of Amazon. The EC2 is sort of a root server providing on demand offered by Amazon for 0.20 $ per hour. This would mean you pay about 144 USD per month for a decent root server. Not really cheap, but since the service works on a on-demand basis and you only have to pay when you are actually using the server it might be an interesting alternative to renting a real server.</p>

<p>The service is in beta testing still and Jeff mentioned that it might be hard to get in right now, but he promised the situation will improve soon. Maybe we&rsquo;ll give it a try.</p>

China Mobile has outranked Vodafone as the world&rsquo;s largest mobile phone operator. It is really surprising, because Vodafone serves the worldwide market and China Mobile only the Chinese market. Latest figures indicate that China Mobile serves 200 million customers &ndash; Vodafone &ldquo;only&rdquo; 186.8 million.</p>

<p>This just shows us how big the Chinese market is and how many opportunities it offers. Analysts are predicting that China Mobile will expand their business overseas in the next few years.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>According to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.telephia.com/documents/Applications_release_v5_FINAL_7.5.06_001.pdf#search=%22Telephia%20Mobile%20Applications%20Report%2C%20Q1%202006%22">Telephia</a> <strong>MapQuest Mobile</strong> (21.9 %) was the top revenue-generating downloadable mobile application in the first quarter of 2006. In second position came <strong>The Weather Channel</strong> (5.7 %) and in third the <strong>Verizon Superpages 2.0</strong> (5.3 %). Two music applications, Music Choice and Sirius Music, rounded out the top five with revenue shares of 5 % and 4.8 %.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Local maps/directions and up-to-date weather are well-suited to delivery via mobile phones because they are information needs characterized by immediacy, location-specificity, and time- sensitivity,&rdquo; said Kanishka Agarwal, Vice President of New Products, Telephia. &ldquo;Downloadable mobile applications present a significant opportunity for higher ARPU (Average Revenue Per User), with more than 3.3 million mobile consumers downloading these applications during the first quarter of the year.&rdquo;</p>

<p><img alt="Top 10 Downloadable Mobile Applications by Total Revenue Share (U.S.)" id="image39" src="http://www.pavingways.com/wp-content/uploads/Telephia_Grafik1.jpg" /> (Data does not include revenue for mobile TV and mobile game applications which is reported separately)</p>

<p>Another interesting fact is, that maps/directions applications drive repeat purchase revenue, while entertainment applications claim highest revenue share for first-time purchases:</p>

<p><img alt="Top Downloadable Mobile Applications by Repeat Purchase Revenue Share (U.S.)" id="image40" src="http://www.pavingways.com/wp-content/uploads/Telephia_Grafik2.jpg" /> Maps/Directions and Weather applications are leading in repeat purchases. In contrary, nearly 30 % of first-time purchase revenues were driven by the Entertainment category, with streaming music mobile applications, Music Choice and Sirius Music, securing the highest new purchase revenue share at nearly 9 % and 8 %.</p>

In Japan the browser powered by Opera is already available (since July 24, 2006).</p>

<p>Taking advantage of the DS&#8217; built-in Wi-Fi capabilities the browser allows the user to<img align="right" alt="Nintendo DS cartridge" id="image37" title="Nintendo DS cartridge" src="http://www.pavingways.com/wp-content/uploads/nintendo-ds-with-cartridge.thumbnail.jpg" /> access the full internet, incl. webmail, online shops or secure bank websites. The browser will be sold as an optional DS card. Users simply insert the card into the Wi-Fi enabled Nintendo DS, connect to a network, and begin browsing on two screens. Users will also be able to apply an optional filter (provided by Astaro) that will block inappropriate content for underage surfers. The recommended retail price is around <strong>GBP 30 / 40 Euros</strong>.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Review: ONSPEED Mobile browser]]></title>
    <link href="http://pavingways.github.io/review-onspeed-mobile_10.html"/>
    <updated>2006-07-27T03:36:51+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://pavingways.github.io/review-onspeed-mobile_10</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last month I was sitting in the tube in London and saw an ad about ONSPEED Mobile. I have never heard about ONSPEED Mobile. So I was interested and started researching.</p>

<p>ONSPEED Mobile is a mobile web browser. There is a 14 day free trial, after that you have to pay GBP 19.99 per year. When you request web pages or images via the ONSPEED Mobile browser, it&rsquo;s sent directly to ONSPEED&rsquo;s servers where it is then reformated and compressed and then sent direct to your mobile phone. So, the website you visit is an optimised version for your mobile phone (sounds familiar?). The company promises to increase surfing speed by not less than (up to) 10 times and also to reduce the data traffic up to 75%.</p>

<p>The download size of the browser is less than 100KB, but your mobile phone must be Java enabled. You can check out if your mobile phone supports ONSPEED Mobile at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.onspeedmobile.com/en_gb/devices/index.php"><a href="http://www.onspeedmobile.com">http://www.onspeedmobile.com</a></a>. <!--more--> ONSPEED Mobile also manages all of your bookmarks in one location. You can view, create or edit your bookmarks inside the ONSPEED Mobile software. It also maintains the previous browsing history for recalling past web pages.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.onspeedmobile.com/en_gb/home/index.php"> </a></p>

<p>I decided to try the ONSPEED Mobile browser on my mobile phone within the currently offered 14-day trial period. First, I had to install the browser, which took quite a while:</p>

<p>After I entered my phone number &ndash; since I&rsquo;m in Germany right now with my country code starting with a &ldquo;+&rdquo;, the &ldquo;00&rdquo; version was not accepted &ndash; and some personal data on the ONSPEED website I got a text message to my phone with the request to answer the message and send it to another number &ndash; according to the onspeed.com website this costs 50p plus the regular rate for a SMS in my plan.</p>

<p>After that I got another message with a welcoming text telling me that I got a password and I was asked to go to <a href="http://en.onsmob.com">http://en.onsmob.com</a> using my phone to download the browser, which I did.</p>

<p>Upon accessing the download page I was again asked to enter my mobile phone number. This time I was unfortunately not able to enter the number with the leading &ldquo;+&rdquo; in the country code (it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;number only&rdquo; text input field), so I went with the &ldquo;00&rdquo; version.</p>

<p>The page told me, my Nokia 3650 was supported, then I had to choose my &ldquo;operator and contract type&rdquo; I went with the second Vodafone option, since there were two called &ldquo;Vodafone D2 GPRS ISP&rdquo; and &ldquo;Vodafone VFD2 WAP GPRS&rdquo; and I couldn&rsquo;t really decide which one to take&hellip;other options included all the major carriers like e-plus and BASE, O2 and T-mobile, along with Simyo and Jamba! (debitel).</p>

<p>The next screen told me the following: &ldquo;You may need GPRS Settings to use ONSPEED Mobile, click Next to receive them. (Recommended)&rdquo;. So I clicked &ldquo;Next&rdquo;. Above the &ldquo;Next&rdquo;-Link there is a select-box where you can also skip this.</p>

<p>I was told that another SMS had been sent to me which included all the necessary GPRS settings to use ONSPEED Mobile and I was presented with a link to download the browser (finally). The download started and the Java program installed on my phone.</p>

<p>After the installation I went online. I was very surprised, because ONSPEED Mobile looks very similar to Opera Mini. The initial handling of the browser was quite an experience. I got a lot of different errors everytime I tried to open a web page. Maybe my cellphone (Nokia 3650) was the reason, maybe this was related to the phone-number issues in the sign-up process &ndash; I don&rsquo;t really know &ndash; I could not really use the ONSPEED Mobile browser until I rebooted my handset. Then it worked.</p>

<p>As I said, the ONSPEED Mobile browser looked strikingly similar to Opera mini (just not red, but green), so what I did was firing up SeleQ (an S60 filebrowser) and compared the directories of the two Java applications on my phone and there it is: <strong>ONSPEED Mobile essentially IS Opera mini</strong>.</p>

<p>ONSPEED Mobile directory contents:</p>

<p><a class="imagelink" title="CIMG3298.jpg" href="http://www.pavingways.com/wp-content/uploads/CIMG3298.jpg"><img id="image26" alt="CIMG3298.jpg" src="http://www.pavingways.com/wp-content/uploads/CIMG3298.thumbnail.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>Opera mini directory contents:</p>

<p><a class="imagelink" title="CIMG3299.jpg" href="http://www.pavingways.com/wp-content/uploads/CIMG3299.jpg"><img id="image27" alt="CIMG3299.jpg" src="http://www.pavingways.com/wp-content/uploads/CIMG3299.thumbnail.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>Almost identical! Now what was this all about? After testing the two browsers one after the other the case was clear: ONSPEED Mobile really is an Opera mini with some customizations, although in the ONSPEED Mobile browser &ldquo;Opera&rdquo; is not mentioned anywhere (e.g. on the &ldquo;about&rdquo; or &ldquo;3rd party&rdquo; pages).</p>

<p>After a little googling I found the proof for this theory <a href="http://my.opera.com/eskils/blog/show.dml/210482">on the Opera Website</a>. Z GROUP, the company selling the ONSPEED Mobile browser has licenced the technology from Opera and is selling it via their premium SMS and yearly usage-fee service.</p>

<p>Why are they doing this? Basically Z GROUP is trying to make the browser accessible to no-so-techy people (and take money for this). Therefore they offer the premium SMS and the GPRS settings messages &ndash; so anybody can understand the process and set up his or her mobile phone to go online.</p>

<p>Now while this is supposed to be easy and especially easier than just pointing your mobile phone to <a href="http://mini.opera.com/">http://mini.opera.com/</a> and download the browser, it became clear in the beginning of this review that this is clearly not the case: the installation process takes about &frac12; an hour with all the data entry, sending and receiving a bunch of short messages and finally downloading ONSPEED mobile to your phone. I never received the GPRS set-up data &ndash; maybe because it already worked?</p>

<p>Also there seems to be a glitch in the whole concept: remember WHEN you are being asked whether you need the GPRS settings text message or not during the setup process? Correct &ndash; while you are already happily browsing the web on <a href="http://en.onsmob.com">http://en.onsmob.com</a> &ndash; so how could you do this without already having a correctly set-up GPRS connection? But maybe I really missed something here.</p>

<p>The only real difference between the two browsers (apart from the color scheme) is the start page &ndash; while my version of Opera mini shows just an input field for the URL, an eBay search field, my bookmarks and my recently visited pages while not having to connect to the web, the ONSPEED Mobile browser forces me to go online. It also shows me a text input for the URL to be visited and also the remaining days of my trial period (probably that&rsquo;s what the web connection is used for), a Google search input field and several &ldquo;Useful Links&rdquo;. These links appear to be less useful, but more &ldquo;sponsored&rdquo; and include: Hotmail, BBC News, Sky Football News, Amazon, eBay, Pipex Broadband, lastminute.com and Z GROUP PLC. They all did not work, which was strange. However the last link on the page worked: &ldquo;Click <em>here</em> to advertise&rdquo;. Funny. I really missed my recently visited pages, because this has kept me from entering the last URL quite often in Opera mini.</p>

<p>Anyways, to summarize this review with a twist in the middle: I don&rsquo;t understand why I should pay GBP 19.99 a year plus at least one premium SMS for this, when I can have the same browser for free and without giving all my private data away to some company?! Too bad Z GROUP doesn&rsquo;t (have to) mention that the whole ONSPEED Mobile browser is just a green painted version of Opera mini. That would have saved me quite some time and at least 50p ;)</p>
