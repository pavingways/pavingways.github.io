  <div class="entry-content">Last week we attended the <a href="http://www.pavingways.com/mobile-internet-conference-in-berlin_174.html">Mobile Internet Conference in Berlin</a>. As already mentioned in <a href="http://www.pavingways.com/mobile-internet-conference-in-berlin_174.html">an earlier post</a>, Rocco was chairing the pre-conference day (31th March). A few startups were presenting at this day, amongst them <a href="http://trutap.com/">Trutap</a> and <a href="http://www.itsmy.com">itsmy.com</a>. Other presentations  (YouTube Mobile, Cyworld, Yahoo! Spain) also gave interesting insights.<br>
<a href="http://www.pavingways.com/interesting-mobile-news_161.html">YouTube Mobile</a> for example is most accessed in Japan followed by USA and UK.  Its first launch version (alpha version) featured only a few thousands of videos and the distribution was mainly through carriers and mobile phone distributors. While its launch of the second version offers almost all the YouTube videos and experiences a 15 times increase in views per day. Right now YouTube Mobile does not include advertisement, but since it belongs to Google we can expect some kind of advertising soon.<br>
<br>
On the next 2 conference days the presentations were mainly held by carriers (3 AUSTRIA, Magyar Telekom, O2 Germany, Swisscom Mobile, etc.). It was interesting to hear that carriers still (try to) open up. A very good example was 3 AUSTRIA. The presentation was very insightful and Alexander Franz showed how they are dealing with the changing environment and the shifting from voice to data. He introduced some interesting business models and explained the &#8221;<a href="http://www.3skypephone.com/english/index.html">Skype Phone</a>&#8221; for 99 EUR.<br>
<br>
All in all it was a very interesting event with many interesting and diverse companies. And of course another great networking opportunity.

  <div class="entry-content">There was another MMM (Mobile Monday in Munich) today. We missed all the presentations, they were almost exclusively about mobile gaming, so no biggie for us. We met the &#8220;usual suspects&#8221; and I&#8217;m getting the feeling to get into a MoMo community somehow. Lots of software vendors and game programmers were around.<br>
<br>
I talked to the guys from <a href="http://deviceanywhere.com/">DeviceAnywhere</a> and had to learn they were actually also the guys from &#8220;Mobile Complete&#8221;! While talking to them I somehow thought these would be separate companies, but they are not. I scored a 3hrs free trial for the DeviceAnywhere service - will try later this week with our current <a href="http://groupile.com">Groupile</a> alpha. I already know the service and it&#8217;s great. They just launched the Japanese devices and if you have an account with them you get the Japanese ones for free for a while. So now we&#8217;re really thinking about getting an account. Need to check pricing again.<br>
<br>
Also I met someone from the MoMo team who told me about the <a href="http://www.mobile-monday.de/c/portal/layout?p_l_id=PUB.1.88">Demo Night they will have on May 19th</a>. We&#8217;ll see if we submit <a href="http://groupile.com">Groupile</a> for that. Might be nice, 5 min presentations w/o PowerPoint slides - only live demos. By then we should be in <a href="http://groupile.com">public beta</a>.

The event is organized by <a href="http://www.iir-events.com">IIR Telecoms</a> and they asked me to chair the sessions on Monday 03/31/2008.<br>
<br>
The topic for my introduction for that day is &#8216;Mobile Web 2.0&#8217;. I&#8217;ll start learning all the buzz words of the past 3 years by heart over the weekend to be prepared ;)<br>
<br>
Maybe I can slip in a little announcement concerning the long awaited launch of the<a href="http://groupile.com/"> Groupile Beta</a> that&#8217;s due in April. We have about 140 people waiting, they signed up without really knowing what to expect, some of them are waiting since last year. April will clear things up.<br>
<br>
The conference is gonna be a big opportunity to network and get in touch with many great people in the mobile and mobile web area. The speaker roster looks great even though <a href="http://www.ctiawireless.com/events/event_details.cfm?calID=670">CTIA/IEEE WCNC 2008 in Las Vegas</a> is at the same time. On Monday the following companies will be presenting and hold a roundtable discussion at the end of the day:<ul>	<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com">Google YouTube</a></li>	<li><a href="http://www.bluenove.fr/">Bluenove/Orange</a></li>	<li><a href="http://trutap.com/">trutap</a></li>	<li><a href="http://us.cyworld.com/">Cyworld</a></li>	<li><a href="http://www.itsmy.com/itsmy/">itsmy.com</a></li>	<li><a href="http://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo!</a></li>	<li><a href="http://www.emap.com">emap</a></li>	<li><a href="http://www.zed.com">Zed</a></li>	<li><a href="http://www.telecomitalia.com">Telecom Italia</a></li>	<li><a href="http://www.eyeka.com/">Eyeka</a></li>	<li><a href="http://www.blinkbox.com/">blinkBox</a></li></ul><br>
The W3C, Jamba and many international carriers will also be there and present throughout the conference.<br>
<br>
We&#8217;re looking forward to meet you there, too!

  <div class="entry-content">We were invited to speak at <a href="http://www.iir-events.com/IIR-conf/Telecoms/EventView.aspx?EventID=1418">this year&#8217;s FMC Summit</a> on rather short notice about three weeks ago. The event was organized by <a href="http://www.iir-events.com/IIR-conf/Default.aspx">IIR Telecoms &amp; Technology</a> and took place in Munich from 03/11/08 to 03/14/08. We had a chance to present <a href="http://www.pavingways.com/">PavingWays</a> and <a href="http://groupile.com/">Groupile</a> in the first of two &#8220;Innovation Showcase&#8221; sessions on Wednesday. It was a nice opportunity to present what we are working on to a critical and at least in part mobile-web-oriented audience.<br>
<br>
To be honest we didn&#8217;t really know what <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_Multimedia_Subsystem#Fixed.2FMobile_Convergence">FMC</a> was before the conference, but since it apparently was a topic incorporating &#8220;mobile&#8221; and &#8220;convergence&#8221; we felt like it was a good fit for us. FMC, belonging to the wide field of IMS, actually encompasses a wide range of services and technologies, mostly related to network infrastructure and the bundling and the convergence of various products, such as mobile and fixed line tariffs or DSL, phone and TV bundles also known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_play_(telecommunications)">Triple play</a>.<br>
<br>
We met many interesting people from an incredible amount of different countries, such as Belgium, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Egypt, Finland, Turkey, the UK. Most of them were representatives of major mobile carriers/network operators. We also had interesting discussions with representatives of the <a href="http://www.wi-fi.org/">Wi-Fi Alliance</a> and the <a href="http://devicemanagementforum.org/">Device Management Forum</a>.<br>
<br>
Some interesting points and thoughts from the presentations at the conference:<br>
<br>
- Question: Will cool and ubiquitous devices (GSM, WiFI, Homezone) be network operator independent? That means the user could then choose the cheapest or quickest connection on demand across providers.<br>
Answer (T-Mobile): Users would love it, because polls show they see their mobile handset as a friend, but the provider as the cleaning lady. Users also want a cheap handset, but T-Mobile don&#8217;t think that this will be happening. On the contrary T-Mobile Germany has an exclusive partnerhsip with Apple and they think this will be the way to go in the future.<br>
<br>
- T-Mobile is relaxed about VoIP coming to the iPhone, because you can already make phone calls with it as opposed to a laptop where VoIP fills a gap.<br>
<br>
- telephone numbers will become less relevant, sometime in the future it could be replaced by something like your Facebook or MySpace account<br>
<br>
Thanks go out to Alex from IIR Telecoms for the nicely organized and well managed event.

  <div class="entry-content">I totally forgot blogging about that and more or less for completeness reasons I want to mention that I have been attending the Google Android developer day in Munich (actually in Aschheim/Dornach) on January 29, 2008. I met Jason Chen, one of the presenters at the event, the day before at the Mobile Monday in Munich.<br>
<br>
The people attending, at least most people I have been talking to, were mobile developers sent by their companies, pretty big ones. There were some start-up people there too, but not many. Comments and questions in general were pretty critical, detailed and practical. Interesting was the big interest of taking part in the <a href="http://code.google.com/android/adc.html">Google Android development competition</a> from the audience. Apparently mentioning 10 mio USD in price-money creates some interest ;)<br>
<br>
I was of course mostly interested in the WebKit-based web browser in Android and I have to say it worked pretty well in the SDK emulator, it even has <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/wurflajax/message/73">the same &#8220;bug&#8221;</a> that I had experienced while testing the <a href="http://frostlib.org">Frost library</a> on the iPhone when it came out. So no surprises there too and one more browser to look at when developing mobile web apps, even though it&#8217;s almost the same browser as on the iPhone or Nokia&#8217;s S60 3rd edition phones (also exhibiting the &#8220;bug&#8221; mentioned above - so it&#8217;s apparently a WebKit issue after all).<br>
<br>
Bottom line is: no surprises after all, Google leaves no event without mentioning that they&#8217;re looking for developers and if you&#8217;re interested in Android development, <a href="http://code.google.com/android/download.html">get the SDK</a> and <a href="http://code.google.com/android/intro/index.html">read the docs</a>.

  <div class="entry-content"><strong>T-Mobile criticized Nokia&#8217;s strategy</strong><br>
T-Mobile ain&#8217;t very happy with Nokia&#8217;s strategy offering more and more own services. Last summer Nokia announced <a href="http://ovi.nokia.com">Ovi</a>, a paid internet portal for music downloads and navigation. So Nokia breaks into a part of the value-added chain, which T-Mobile occupied until yet. T-Mobile boss Hamid Akhavan emphasized that Nokia&#8217;s solo attempt will lead to conflicts.<strong>Source:</strong> <a href="http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/103265">http://www.heise.de</a><br>
<strong>Vodafone deepens partnership with RIM</strong><br>
Vodafone announced to deepen the partnership with <a href="http://www.blackberry.com">Research in Motion (RIM)</a>. Within this partnership Vodafone wants to develop own consumer services for the Blackberry platform. Until now they mostly eyed business customers. Unlike in Europe, Blackberry enjoys great popularity by average consumers in the US.<strong>Source:</strong> <a href="http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/103270">http://www.heise.de</a><br>

<strong>Ericsson will be FIFA partner</strong><br>
In 2009 and 2010 FIFA (Federation Internationale de Football Association)<br>
will use Ericsson&#8217;s technical infrastructure for the distribution of mobile multimedia services. The center of the agreement is the World Cup 2010 in South Africa. Ericsson will provide content management and service delivery platforms for transferring FIFA products (such as informations services, TV and video) to mobile devices.<strong>Source:</strong> <a href="http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/103302">http://www.heise.de</a><br>
<strong>T-Mobile cuts prices for mobile internet abroad</strong><br>
Last week T-Mobile announced 2 - still volume based - new tariffs which apply for all 27 EU-States:<ul>	<li>1 MB data traffic for 2 EUR</li>	<li>50 MB day package for 15 EUR</li></ul><br>
It will be irrelevant, in which foreign network a T-Mobile customer has signed in. Well, mobile surfing gets cheaper in Europe, but it is still very expensive. The new T-Mobile Roaming tariffs will become available in mid-2008.<strong>Source:</strong> <a href="http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/103367">http://www.heise.de</a><br>

Last week at the Mobile World Congress Microsoft introduced a new mobile client called <a href="http://phone.msndirect.com">MSN Direct</a>. It is a free application and runs on Windows Mobile 6 powered smart phones. With MSN Direct you can assemble your own  news service, such as top news stories, weather, stock reports, sports or entertainment news. The content from the MSN portal updates automatically and is displayed on the phone&#8217;s idle screen.<strong>Source:</strong> <a href="http://phone.msndirect.com">http://phone.msndirect.com</a><br>

Starting at the end of March all web enabled T-Mobile devices  will exclusively support Yahoo&#8217;s mobile search service <a href="http://mobile.yahoo.com/onesearch">Onesearch</a>. Users will have access to news, weather, flickr as well as related pages for mobile clients.<br>
This year T-Mobile also wants to introduce mobile Instant Messaging and will therefore support Yahoo Messenger, Windows Live Messenger, ICQ and AIM (AOL Instant Messenger). Up to now T-Mobile prohibits the usage of Instant Messaging services with its Web&#8217;n&#8217;Walk tariffs.<strong>Source:</strong> <a href="http://www.zdnet.de/news/tkomm/0,39023151,39186527,00.htm">http://www.zdnet.de</a><br>
<strong>Ericsson develops mobile multimedia platform </strong><br>
Ericsson has unveiled a new hardware platform for mobile devices in order to help manufacturers develop multimedia devices with multitasking capabilities.<br>
&#8220;The U500 is a powerful multimedia platform with performance, graphics and usability, more resembling a mobile computer than today&#8217;s mobile phones,&#8221; said Robert Puskaric, head of Ericsson&#8217;s mobile platforms business. &#8220;With the U500 platform Ericsson will keep its world leading position within the multimedia mass market for years to come&#8221;.<br>
The U500 platform integrates three ARM11 CPUs (high performance microprocessors) as well as hardware accelerators. The Ericsson U500 will launch early 2009 and can offer highly advanced features like support for WVGA displays (800x480 pixels), high-quality camcorder, 12-megapixel camera, high-resolution video for mobile TV and superior audio performance.<strong>Sources:</strong> <a href="http://news.softpedia.com/news/Ericsson-Unveils-Impressive-Mobile-Platform-78157.shtml">http://news.softpedia.com</a>, <a href="http://www.mobilewhack.com/ericssons-u500-mobile-platform">http://www.mobilewhack.com</a>, <a href="http://www.zdnet.de/news/tkomm/0,39023151,39186601,00.htm">http://www.zdnet.de</a><br>

  <div class="entry-content">Nokia acquires the Norwegian company <a href="http://trolltech.com/">Trolltech</a>  for $153 Million (€104 Million). Trolltech&#8217;s Qt Technology is a cross-platform GUI framework that&#8217;s used in applications such as KDE and Skype.<br>
<br>
&#8220;The acquisition of Trolltech will enable Nokia to accelerate the cross-platform software strategy for mobile devices and desktop applications, and to develop its Internet services business. Nokia plans to continue to develop Trolltech&#8217;s products and continue to drive sales to new and existing customers&#8221; (<a href="http://trolltech.com/28012008/28012008">press release of Trolltech</a>).<br>
<br>
With the open source technology Qt, Nokia plans to support developers creating applications that run on smartphones as well as PC&#8217;s. The acquisition of Trolltech could be Nokia&#8217;s answer to <a href="http://code.google.com/android/">Google&#8217;s Android.</a><br>

  <div class="entry-content"><strong>O2</strong> and <strong>Vodafone</strong> are launching a new billing service in Germany this spring. The service will be accessible to every mobile phone user.<br>
<br>
The new payment system combines the direct debiting system (German: Lastschriftverfahren) with  SMS payment confirmation through mobile phones. That means:<ol>	<li>you order a product on a mobile portal or web shop</li>	<li>then you type in your mobile phone number and password</li>	<li>following you will receive a text message (SMS), which you have to confirm in order to debit the amount from your bank account via direct debiting system.</li></ol><br>
Prepaid customers and customers with cell phones provided by their company as well as customers of other carriers need to register once and for free for this online payment system.<br>
<br>
Due to the handling of payments via two independent communication media, the payment security will be clearly increased according to Vodafone and O2. A prior registration giving bank account details and credit card numbers does not apply.<br>
<br>
The whole payment service sounds very easy and promising. I am very curious about testing it.<br>

  <div class="entry-content">Last week, <strong>NTT DoCoMo</strong>, Japan&#8217;s biggest mobile phone carrier with nearly 53 million subscribers, and <strong>Google</strong> announced their partnership that includes providing search services and search-related advertisement. The service is scheduled to be launching in spring 2008.<br>
Besides, other Google services will be made available for i-mode users, such as a pre-installed application of Google Maps on i-mode handsets.<br>
<br>
In the near future GMail, YouTube and Picasa will be also accessible through i-mode. In addition, in all upcoming NTT DoCoMo handsets with a capable HTML browser, Google will be set as starting page.<br>
<br>
NTT DoCoMo may also introduce handsets that will use Google&#8217;s &#8220;Android&#8221; mobile software package in Japan - probably in the second half of this year.  Not very surprising since NTT DoCoMo is a part of Android&#8217;s Open Handset Alliance.<br>
<br>
This partnership will give Google a better access not only to the mobile market, but also to the search engine market in Japan, where Google lags behind Yahoo.<br>
<br>
Mobile service subscriptions exceeded 100 million in Japan as of the end of 2007, with almost 70 million users accessing the Internet through their mobile phones.<br>
