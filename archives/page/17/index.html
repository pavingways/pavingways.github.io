  <div class="entry-content">The number of mobile phone subscriptions in Germany has increased: For the first time there are <strong>more mobile phones than residents</strong>. 82.8 million mobile phones are currently registered. Most Germans have 2 or even 3 mobile phones. And the trend continues: in Italy there are also more mobile phones than people: 120 phones per 100 Italians.<br>
<br>
It would be interesting to know what kind of mobile phones people are using and how WAP 2.0 devices are distributed amongst the whole 83 million in Germany.<br>

  <div class="entry-content">Last month I was sitting in the tube in London and saw an ad about ONSPEED Mobile. I have never heard about ONSPEED Mobile. So I was interested and started researching.<br>
<br>
ONSPEED Mobile is a mobile web browser. There is a 14 day free trial, after that you have to pay GBP 19.99 per year.<br>
When you request web pages or images via the ONSPEED Mobile browser, it&#8217;s sent directly to ONSPEED&#8217;s servers where it is then reformated and compressed and then sent direct to your mobile phone. So, the website you visit is an optimised version for your mobile phone (sounds familiar?). The company promises to increase surfing speed by not less than (up to) 10 times and also to reduce the data traffic up to 75%.<br>
<br>
The download size of the browser is less than 100KB, but your mobile phone must be Java enabled. You can check out if your mobile phone supports ONSPEED Mobile at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.onspeedmobile.com/en_gb/devices/index.php">http://www.onspeedmobile.com</a>.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><a href="http://2006.dconstruct.org/">d.Construct 2006</a> is a one-day web conference in Brighton, England, on the 8th of September. It is organized by the nice guys from <a href="http://www.clearleft.com/">Clearleft</a>, namely <a href="http://adactio.com/journal/">Jeremy Keith</a>, <a href="http://andybudd.com/">Andy Budd</a> and <a href="http://clagnut.com/">Richard Rutter</a>.<br>
<br>
To quote from the <a href="http://2006.dconstruct.org/">website</a>, d.Construct &#8220;&#8230; discusses how new technology is transforming the web from a document delivery system into an application platform.&#8221; So it seems we&#8217;re going to be at the right place - also for (mobile) web applications!<br>
<br>
We are looking forward to seeing many people from the <a href="http://www.vivabit.com/atmedia2006/">atmedia event this year</a> and we hope to get in touch with many new people in the mobile area as well.<br>

  <div class="entry-content">There are many new mobile services appearing on the web almost everyday. Here on PavingWays we are trying to keep up to date and we will review selected services from time to time. We will start with tiggdo.com.<br>
<strong>What is tiggdo?</strong><br>
On <a href="http://www.tiggdo.com">tiggdo.com</a> you can create your personal phone&#8217;s homepage with services that provide information or news you require. Right now there are already a couple of services available, e.g. RSS feeds, maps, traffic reports, weather, stock quotes, job search etc. For all available services check out <a href="http://www.tiggdo.com/about.php">the about page on tiggdo.com</a><br>
tiggdo.com is free to use and if you are an developer, you can ask the tiggdo team to add your service.</div>

  <div class="entry-content">&#8220;Last year, 56 per cent of multimedia phone owners used it to browse their operator&#8217;s portal, as opposed to 36 per cent in 2004. Yet those 56 per cent only browsed &#8216;at least once per month.&#8217; That&#8217;s a massive missed opportunity.

<strong>Panel: Cameron Adams, Peter-Paul Koch (PPK), Stuart Langridge, Dan Webb, and Simon Willison - JavaScript libraries: friend or foe?</strong><br>
This JavaScript experts panel discussed some advantages and drawbacks in the field of JavaScript libraries, such as the <a title="Dojo toolkit homepage" href="http://dojotoolkit.org/">Dojo toolkit</a> or the <a title="Yahoo User Interface Library homepage" href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/">Yahoo User Interface Library</a>. These libraries offer a common programming interface for JavaScript and especially AJAX, to overcome cross-browser issues and can thus greatly increase productivity. </div>

  <div class="entry-content">The PavingWays team was in London from June 15th to 16th to attend the <a href="http://www.vivabit.com/atmedia2006/">@media conference 2006</a>. @media basically is a web design conference (&#8220;Europe&#8217;s foremost professional web design conference&#8221;), so most of the talks and panels were less technical and focussed mainly on design issues. However, some speakers also talked about things like DOM scripting or bug fixing, so there was some technological input as well.<br>
<br>
Since we try to keep the focus on (mobile) devices here, let&#8217;s look at the things that were said at @media that are relevant to us:</div>

  <div class="entry-content">So, what is PavingWays? Frankly we&#8217;re not quite sure yet, but here&#8217;s a quick list of stuff that is probably going to appear on the this page, most probably on the blog section:<ul><li>anything that we find interesting about web applications on devices (mostly mobile ones)</li></ul><br>
Admittedly a short list, but it basically says what this is (going to be) all about.<br>
What this precisely is or will be only time will tell. We know however that we are going to blog about anything, such as articles, press releases, tutorials and conferences in the field on mobile web applications. This can and probably will be divided into core and related technologies and topics, such as XHTML(-MP), CSS, JavaScript, AJAX, SVG and so on. <br>
<br>
Devices and browsers themselves are also (going to be) a major topic of course, actually this will be one of the first things we will be looking at: <b>We are planning to create sort of a collaborative mobile browser comparison chart</b>, where we and hopefully a lot of contributors will be collecting their findings on how the many different browsers on the many devices out there are supporting the technologies that are important to us as web developers. We&#8217;ll be looking at stuff like AJAX support, but also more basic things, such as how CSS definitions are displayed (if they are at all) or even more basic if a given browser supports XHTML(-MP) at all.<br>
<br>
We invite anybody who is interested in these things and especially in this first project of ours to join us and get in touch!
