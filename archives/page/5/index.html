  <div class="entry-content"><span>I have been asked to do part of the technical review of a new book from </span><a href="http://www.apress.com">Apress</a><span> called &#8217;</span><a href="http://www.apress.com/book/view/9781430226208">Beginning Smartphone Web Development</a><span>&#8217; and was happy to help. </span>

<span>The book is written by </span><a href="http://learnthemobileweb.com">Gail Rahn Frederick</a> and from what I have seen so far the book is going to become a great introduction to mobile web development. All the necessary fundamentals are well covered and explained with practical examples and there are some more advanced sections on using Ajax and device capability databases.

Anybody interested in the challenges and details of mobile web development can take away something from the book. Publication is due in December 2009, so make sure you put it on your <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Smartphone-Web-Development-Applications/dp/143022620X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1259427032&amp;sr=8-1">Amazon wishlist</a> now!

  <div class="entry-content">Last week we attended the <a href="http://bgf2009.de/">Browsergames Forum 2009</a> in Frankfurt. This forum/conference brought together people and companies from the browser based games area. Germany is a serious location for all browser games (<a href="http://de.bigpoint.com/">BigPoint</a>, <a href="http://traviangames.de/">Travian Games</a>, <a href="http://www.innogames.de/en">Innogames</a> &#8230;) so it wasn&#8217;t really surprising that 90% of all attendees were German as well, but we also met people from Bulgaria, Portugal and Israel.

Recently, we have been developing two mobile browser based games for UK clients (news about those soon here) and this conference was perfect for us to see what is going on in this market, what are the upcoming trends and how to make money in this area.

There were <a href="http://bgf2009.de/BGF-Programm-stand30102009.pdf">several talks</a>, with topics ranging from programing, monetizing, financing to marketing and legal topics and they answered most of our questions above. Unlike typical web startups it seemed to me that browser game companies do not struggle with finding their business model and earning money. They make (in many cases loads of) money, especially by selling items to users.

And options for these item sales are virtually unlimited. Patrick Streppel (CEO <a href="http://www.gamigo.de/">Gamigo Games AG</a>) talked about the possibilities. His company had replaced fantasy cars for real and licensed cars (such as BMW, Audi, &#8230;) in a game, because the users wanted that and it felt more natural to them and accordingly sales increased vastly. Another interesting story was that in the game you can buy golf clubs which can be used 100,000 times and then have to be replaced by a new one. In another game the users can buy an insurance for their sword in order to be protected against damage. &#8220;Buy one, get one free&#8221; campaigns or bundle sales are very popular too. There were also some companies offering monetisation models for free-to-play games, such as <a href="http://www.sponsorpay.com/de/en/home">SponsorPay</a> or <a href="http://www.fatfoogoo.com/">fatfoogoo</a>. With these players can basically get premium services or virtual goods/money in games by doing surveys or signing up for other services etc.</div>

  <div class="entry-content">As you can see in <a href="../mobile-widget-wiki/app-store-overview">our Widget and App Store Wiki</a>, a lot of phone manufacturers and operators have already joined the mobile applications battle or are planning their move in this direction. To promote their platforms and app stores and to attract new developers many of them have started <a href="http://www.pavingways.com/mobile-widget-wiki/widget-development-competitions">competitions</a>, usually with nice prizes to be won.

Have a look at the following currently ongoing competitions:
<ol>
	<li><a href="http://www.nn4d.com/site/global/market/lbs_challenge/p_lbs_home.jsp"><strong>NAVTEQ Global LBS Challenge</strong></a>
<strong>PRIZE:</strong><strong> global prize pool</strong><strong> currently at $8.2 million USD in cash and licenses</strong>
<strong> DEADLINE: November 6, 2009</strong> (EMEA region)

The NAVTEQ Global LBS Challenge is focused on driving the development and visibility of innovative location-based solutions (LBS) for wireless devices. From business applications to sports, travel and security, integrating the accuracy and richness of NAVTEQ digital map data facilitates the discovery of the next wave of LBS using dynamic positioning technology. Winners are chosen by a panel of distinguished judges in each of five regions (EMEA, India, South America, North America, APAC).

Registration for the LBS Challenge, EMEA Region has been extended to November 6, 2009.  A completed solution is not required at the time of  registration.

  <div class="entry-content">Handset makers <a href="http://www.rim.com/">Research in Motion</a> (RIM), <a href="http://www.lg.com/">LG Electronics</a>, <a href="http://www.sharpusa.com/">Sharp</a> and <a href="http://www.samsung.com/">Samsung Electronics</a> have joined the<a href="http://www.jil.org/"> Joint Innovation Lab (JIL)</a> and will support JIL widget specification in future mobile handsets from Q1 2010.

The decision of LG, RIM, Samsung and Sharp to incorporate the JIL widget specifications in their future product roadmap is proof of the tremendous potential that JIL offers both to developers and customers, said Peters Suh, JIL CEO. All four companies are innovation leaders and this is another strong affirmation of both JIL strategy and its robust technical specifications.

  <div class="entry-content">At the <a href="http://www.iaa.de/">IAA in Frankfurt</a> (Frankfurt Motor Show) in September 2009 <a href="http://www.bmw.com/com/en/index.html">BMW</a>, <a href="http://www.nokia.com/">Nokia</a> and <a href="http://www.parrot.com/usa/">Parrot SA</a> unveiled plans for bringing smart phone applications to cars.

&#8220;For software developers, this opens a whole new domain to sell their apps. For car makers, apps provide new ways to deliver infotainment and telematics services to customers. For motorists, apps allow them to enjoy their infotainment systems to the fullest, while paying only for the applications they want, thus saving them money. With apps so critical to the automotive market, companies are pushing approaches that benefit their specific goals. While the solutions shown at IAA were only concepts, they clearly reflect what will soon be on the market.&#8221; said Kevin Hamlin, analyst for automotive electronics at <a href="http://www.isuppli.com/Pages/home.aspx">iSuppli Corp</a>.

Sounds good? Yes. Where&#8217;s the catch? Doing it right!

The other panelists were Suzanne Koranyi-Esser (Editorial  Director of <a href="http://www.rd.com/international/shared/?countryid=de">Reader&#8217;s Digest</a> Germany,  Switzerland, Austria) and <span class="Stil6">Patrik  Jaros (</span><span class="Stil6">star chef, cookbook  author, CEO of </span>FOODLOOK Studio GmbH). Siobhan O`Leary (literary  agent, translator and writer) was moderating this panel. Good job everyone!

The panel discussion was quite interesting and some publishers are already playing around with mobile applications. Patrik Jaros mentioned that he released a couple of <a href="http://www.pitaya-media.com/">cooking applications</a> for different mobile platforms (iPhone, Blackberry, Android). Reader&#8217;s Digest has also an iPhone app available for download called &#8220;allrecipes.com DinnerSpinner&#8221; and it is related to <a href="http://allrecipes.de">RD&#8217;s online community of hobby cooks</a> (German version). The discussion was not about mobile exclusively, but digital in general. Questions ranged from &#8220;Should the content in an application be released for free or not?&#8221;, &#8220;Is the classic cookbook dead?&#8221; to &#8220;What kind of strategy should publishers and retailers follow in the digital/mobile space?&#8221;.</div>

  <div class="entry-content">Yesterday we went to the <a href="http://www.webmontag.de/location/frankfurt/2009-10-12">Webmontag in Frankfurt</a>. It took off at 7 pm and was pretty well attended (&gt;100 people). First there were some presentations about <a href="https://www.xing.com/profile/Mario_Hachemer">Barcamps in general</a>, <a href="http://www.andreas-demmer.de/2009/10/13/gestern-war-web-montag-in-frankfurt/">Conceptual Designers</a>, <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/PRDoktor/verachtet-mir-die-klassik-nicht-2205673">PR &amp; social media</a>, <a href="http://prezi.com/tghs4c98htj0/">Wikis for agencys and companies</a> and <a href="http://tautoko.info/">why todolists fail</a>. I really liked the twitter wall even though the filter only worked for the hashtag  #Webmontag and not for #wmfra.

1.5 hours later the networking part started. Nice people, nice talks. Here are some photos from yesterday @ <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dc7590/tags/webmontag12102009/show/">flickr.com</a>.

The next Webmontag Frankfurt is scheduled for <a href="http://www.webmontag.de/location/frankfurt/index">04. December</a>. One talk will be about Google Wave. Btw many thanks to <a href="http://www.webmontag.de/person/darren_cooper">Darren</a> &amp; the rest of the orga team for organizing this! See you there!

PS: There are some more interesting events coming up:

For the first time, the Frankfurt Book Fair is offering over 400 qm exclusively to the world of food, wine and all things epicurean. The <a href="http://www.gourmet-gallery.de/en/">Gourmet Gallery</a> (in Hall 5.0), one of the highlights at the book fair, features a show kitchen for live demonstrations by prominent chefs as well as talks, discussions, interviews etc. about everything cooking- and gourmet-related.

The topic of the panel discussion that I am participating in is &#8221;<a href="http://www.gourmet-gallery.de/en/encookingdigital.html"><strong>Cooking digital, digital Cooking: digital innovations and initiatives</strong></a>&#8221;. It is a B2B talk where we want to discuss examples for new ways for cookery books, trends, innovations and business models for chefs or publishing representatives. We will also talk about electronic culinary schools and getting recipes on your mobile.

Insights from the huge amount of mobile application stores and the emerging mobile widgets market will be things I can contribute, and findings from our research on these topics will come in handy, so I hope. In case you haven&#8217;t seen our wiki yet, it&#8217;s the place where we collect all <a title="Mobile Widget Engine &amp; App Store Wiki" href="http://www.pavingways.com/mobile-widget-wiki/">available information about app stores and widget</a> engines - our main area of business meanwhile.

It&#8217;s my first time at the Frankfurt Book Fair and I am really looking forward to this interesting panel. Many thanks to <a href="http://www.mobile-zeitgeist.com/">Heike Scholz</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/MobileZeitgeist">@MobileZeitgeist</a> for getting me in touch!

So what were all these experts and enthusiasts talking about? <strong>Widgets and app stores of course!</strong>

We enjoyed many interesting sessions and right from the keynotes by speakers from <a href="http://bondi.omtp.org/">OMTP/BONDI</a>, <a href="http://www.vodafone.co.uk">Vodafone</a> and <a href="http://www.wipconnector.com/">WIP</a> one thing was clear: <strong>mobile widgets and application stores are what the mobile industry is all about right now</strong>.

For us at PavingWays this is not different, ever since <a href="http://www.pavingways.com/mobile-widgets-the-ubiquitous-mobile-web_84.html">we thought mobile widgets would make the mobile web more ubiquitous</a> we have been looking at this area very closely.

  <div class="entry-content">We are really looking forward to our next trip to London. This week is &#8221;<a href="http://www.londondigitalweek.com/">London Digital Week</a>&#8221; and we will be attending <a href="http://overtheair.org/">Over The Air </a> - 24 hour of mobile development, a mobile developer and design event. Too bad we knew about London Digital Week too late, so we will miss <a href="http://www.londondigitalweek.com/events.php">some other (mobile related) events</a>, such as <a href="http://mktools.forum.nokia.com/invitation/ovideveloperevent?cp=0809A&amp;entry=OviEventarticle7">Nokia Ovi Developer Open Door</a>.

I am really happy that I am one of the speakers at <a href="http://overtheair.org/blog/about-over-the-air/">Over The Air 2009</a>. The line-up of speakers is great and the topics are impressive. There will be panels, sessions, discussions, workshops etc. - all about mobile development and design topics and there will also be an all-night hack-a-thon.

<a href="http://overtheair.org/blog/session-portable-widgets/">My session &#8220;Mobile Widgets - Worth the hassle?&#8221;</a> focuses on comparing the <strong>different widget engines</strong> out there, on already existing and planned <strong>application stores</strong> and the question: <strong>is it worth to develop for one specific app store/engine or not</strong>.  I will also present an open wiki project collecting information about app stores and widget engines and invite the community to participate. Watch this space for update about this!

<span class="status-body"><span class="entry-content">Due to overwhelming popular demand the organizers have released more tickets for Over the Air - register <a href="http://overtheair09.eventbrite.com/">here</a>. I think Over The Air will be THE mobile event this year packed with </span></span>a lot of bleeding edge knowledge to gain and interesting people in the mobile space to meet.

If you are not able to attend, you can stay updated by following my tweets - <a href="http://twitter.com/GeeROC">@GeeROC</a> - and of course there will be a summary blog post right here too.
