    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="http://www.webinos.org"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1512" title="webinos logo" src="http://www.pavingways.com/wp-content/uploads/webinos1.png" alt="" width="150" height="48" /></a><a href="http://webinos.org/">Webinos</a></strong> is a pan-European initiative trying to build a &ldquo;<strong>Secure WebOS Application Delivery Environment</strong>&rdquo;. It aims to create an open source platform that will &ldquo;enable web applications and services to be used and shared consistently and securely over a broad spectrum of converged and connected devices, including mobile, PC, home media (TV) and in-car units&rdquo;.<br>
 <br>
The consortium is led by the <a href="http://www.fokus.fraunhofer.de/en/fokus/index.html">Frauenhofer Institute for Open Communication Systems</a> and has already <a href="http://webinos.org/members">22 partners</a> including W3C, Samsung, Sony Ericsson, Telefonica, docomo, Deutsche Telekom, BMW and the University of Oxford. It has received a €10m funding from the EU and will run over three years.<br>
 <strong>Will webinos solve the fragmentation problem?</strong><br>
 <br>
As many developers know there are a lot of different application platforms out there already (Android, iPhone, Symbian, Web &hellip; you name it). Fragmentation and porting applications are huge issues for developers and expensive in regards to development cost and time.<br>
 <br>
The new consortium wants to solve this problem by creating an open source, web-based platform that would allow the same application to run across a very wide variety of device types. The platform can be used on any handset regardless of the OEM or carrier. Basically a universal OS or runtime environment to write once, run anywhere.<br>
 <strong>A very ambitious goal! </strong>Especially considering that maximum compatibility usually comes in a <em>least common denominator</em> package.<br>
 <br>
For us this project first and foremost raises some questions:<ul>   <li>How do other projects like JIL/the <a href="http://www.pavingways.com/the-holy-wholesale-applications-community-wac_1225.html"><strong>Wholesale Applications Community</strong></a> (WAC) fit into the picture? They also aim to create open platforms for mobile apps and solve the fragmentation problem.</li>   <li>Is this gonna be a corporate-driven <a href="http://www.phonegap.com/">PhoneGap</a>?</li>   <li>Comparable to other approaches like <a href="http://www.mobileopenlaszlo.org">Mobile OpenLaszlo</a>?</li>   <li>Will HTML5 have a big part in this? (probably it will)</li> <li>How small will the least common denominator really be?</li> <li>No matter how web-based you are you need to deal with browser issues and fragmentation &ndash; how is this solved?</li>   <li>Are there too many cooks in the kitchen?</li>   <li>Where do Google, Apple and Nokia (and many others) fit into this?</li>  <li>Where are the developers? It is a tough task to convince developers to develop for your platform, no matter how great it might be. Other companies are already spending millions on this (some more successful than others).</li>   <li>Is someone of webinos going to present the project at the <a href="http://www.pavingways.com/mobile-unconference-coming-to-germany_1489.html">Mobile Unconference in November</a>?</li></ul><strong>What we think:</strong><br>
 <br>
A well funded project with a noble goal. Lots of players involved, many obstacles to take, many people to convince. The goal is very, very ambitious and the resulting platform will depend on making compromises. The Web is the platform of the future &ndash; this is another proof.<br>

    <link href="http://pavingways.github.io/the-holy-wholesale-applications-community-wac_1549.html"/>
    <updated>2010-02-18T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://pavingways.github.io/the-holy-wholesale-applications-community-wac_1549</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8515813.stm">At MWC </a>a number of the world&rsquo;s leading telco companies including Vodafone, Orange, Samsung, Sony Ericsson, LG, Deutsche Telecom, SK Telecom, Verizon, AT&amp;T or China Mobile have announced the formation of an international alliance called &ldquo;<a href="http://www.wholesaleappcommunity.com/"><strong>Wholesale Applications Community</strong></a>&rdquo; (WAC) &ndash; to battle Apple.<br>
 <br>
They are aiming to build <strong>an open platform for mobile apps to all mobile phone users</strong> and want <strong>to solve the massive fragmentation problem</strong>.<br>
 <br>
They try to develop a common standard for applications within the next 12 months. The WAC is supposed to be a platform NOT an app store.<br>
 <br>
Of course, the app market is still a lucrative business and growing. Analysts at Gardner predict that the number of app downloads will rise to 4.5 billion (from 2.5 billion last year), yielding almost $30bn.<br>
 <br>
So far so good. But what does that mean, especially for us developers? Is this the right approach in the &ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write_once,_run_anywhere">write once, run anywhere</a>&rdquo; direction?<br>
 <br>
The good thing is that the group intends to use existing open standards (JIL, BONDI, W3C) and that will make it a lot easier for developers creating apps across multiple platforms. Besides developers then have only one single gateway to access a vast potential and international customer base. It also saves a lot of time and resources. And the new alliance has access to more than three billion customers.<br>
 <br>
Well, does this sound too perfect to you? There are still a lot of questions and even doubts, right?<!--more--> Did they form this alliance just to beat Apple or do they really care about the developers? I mean in the end they are all competitors and every one wants a big &ndash; if not the biggest &ndash; part of the &ldquo;app market cake&rdquo;, right?<br>
 <br>
I also think it will be really hard to manage an organization of so many well-known and big companies. There will be many time-consuming processes to make even small decisions everybody is pleased with. We can see similar things going on at the W3C already.<br>
 <br>
Another important fact is that some platforms are already &ldquo;hopelessly fragmented&rdquo; as <a href="http://gigaom.com/2010/02/15/why-the-wac-is-whack/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+OmMalik+%28GigaOM%29">giagom</a> points out: Windows has <a href="http://jkontherun.com/2009/02/19/editorial-the-uphill-battle-microsoft-faces-with-windows-mobile/">struggled with the splintering of Windows Mobile</a> and Google is <a href="http://jkontherun.com/2009/10/15/businessweek-android-faces-danger-of-fragmentation/">suffering from the emergence of multiple versions of Android</a>.<br>
 <br>
Will the WAC succeed? I guess it is too early to answer this question, but for sure it will be very very difficult to reach their ambitious goals &ndash; if not impossible. The idea is good and the app market needs standardization, but there are a lot of obstacles to overcome. Probably too many for the big companies that are involved in this organization.<br>
 <br>
Maybe this kind of organization should be built by developers, not telcos who are mainly interested in selling not building apps. Even the Chamber of Industry and Commerce consists of handicraft businesses not of retailers. What do you think?</p>

    <updated>2010-02-18T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://pavingways.github.io/mwc-news-googles-strategy-and-android-windows-marketplace_1565</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Some more interesting news announced at the Mobile Word Congress:<ul>   <li><strong>Google&rsquo;s new strategy &ldquo;Mobile First&rdquo;</strong><br>
Google&rsquo;s new strategy: &ldquo;Mobile First&rdquo;  The company now focuses more on smartphones than on desktops. That means giving mobile top priority and launching new products first on mobile platforms before creating PC versions.<br>
 <br>
(Source: <a href="http://www.brighthand.com/default.asp?newsID=16235&amp;news=Google+Android+OS+CEO+Eric+Schmidt+Mobile+First">brighthand.com</a>)</li></ul><ul>    <li><strong>60,000 Android phone a day</strong><br>
Google&rsquo;s Android launched a year ago and is now available on <strong>26 different devices in 48 countries</strong>. <strong>60.000 Android devices</strong> running this operating systems are now <strong>being sold on a daily basis</strong>  meaning about<strong> 5.4 million</strong> handsets per quarter, or <strong>21 million</strong> per year. <a href="http://www.pavingways.com/smart-phone-sales-up-30-in-q4-2009_1174.html">Apple sold 8.7 million iPhones last quarter and 25 million in 2009</a>. Seems like Android is gaining ground, hopefully internal fragmentation will be taken care of (if that&rsquo;s possible).<br>

 <!--more--></li></ul><ul>  <li><strong>Windows Marketplace for Mobile has been updated</strong><br>
Windows Marketplace for Mobile, Microsoft&rsquo;s application store, has been updated. The biggest change is there will <strong>no</strong> longer be <strong>regional limitations</strong> on where apps are sold. This is great news for non-US customers because they could only see localized apps and the selection was very limited. Now thanks to the &ldquo;geo selector&rdquo; users can browse and purchase applications from different geographic catalogs / countries. The price of each app will show up in the <strong>user&rsquo;s local currency</strong>. Besides users can install downloaded apps onto their <strong>storage cards</strong>.<br>
 <br>
Developers also <strong>do not have to pay a US$10 fee </strong>for submitting their apps to additional markets anymore &ndash; only the US$ 99 submission fee has to be paid. <strong>VOIP apps</strong> will now be allowed unless a carrier specifically prohibits it. Microsoft now also opens its marketplace to <strong>Russia</strong>.<br>
 <br>
BTW Mobilegamesblog.com published some first screenshots of Windows Marketplace for the Windows Phone 7 Series devices. There is no real source named for these images, so they should be considered as a rumor: <a href="http://blog.mobilegamesblog.com/2010/02/first-screens-windows-phone-7-marketplace.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+MobileGamesBlog+%28Mobile+Games+Blog.com%29">mobilegamesblog.com</a><br>

Handset maker Alcatel unveiled a number of new handsets at Mobile World Congress and interestingly its first Android-based phone OT-980. The phone will be available around June for less than 200 EUR in the UK, France, Spain and Italy. But they are still considering using other platforms, such as Windows Mobile, if prices come down.<br>

China Unicom plans to launch low-cost 3G smartphones &ndash; maybe in collaboration with Huawei which has also recognized that smartphones remain too expensive. Key to unlocking the potential usage of 3G is the need for a $150 smartphone with iPhone-like capabilities , said Guo Ping, CSO, Huawei Technologies and chairman of Huawei devices.<br>

Deutsche Telekom plans to further integrate with mobile apps and content stores. By partnering with leading applications stores Deutsche Telekom wants to offer its customers a T-Mobile dedicated channel with specific recommendations and the opportunity for mobile phone billing (instead of credit card payment).<br>
Deutsche Telekom&rsquo;s open mobile internet strategy implies that customers ultimately get access to a wide choice of all available applications, regardless of their mobile phone brand. As a basis we provide easy log-in, registration, and payment processes, as well as Deutsche Telekom channels in existing stores and customer oriented recommendations,&ldquo; states Rainer Deutschmann, Senior Vice President Mobile Products.<br>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.pavingways.com/wp-content/uploads/autolinq1.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1164" style="margin: 1px 5px;" title="autolinq" src="http://www.pavingways.com/wp-content/uploads/autolinq1.png" alt="" width="212" height="133" /></a>Last year in October I wrote in a <a href="http://www.pavingways.com/mobile-applications-hit-cars_1031.html">blog post</a> about smart phone applications coming to cars. Today I read an article about <a href="http://www.telekom.com/">Deutsche Telekom</a> and tyre maker <a href="http://www.conti-online.com/">Continental</a> joining this market as well.<br>
 <br>
They plan to put apps into all vehicles via an Android-based on-board computer. The prototype called <a href="http://www.autolinq.de/"><strong>AutoLinQ</strong></a> will be demonstrated at this year&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.cebit.de/homepage_e">Cebit show</a>. Inspired by the iPhone drivers can search for apps, download music, pick up news, check emails and answer them by using voice recording technology. The promise is: <strong>all without taking hands off the wheel or eyes off the road!</strong><br>
 <br>
Deutsche Telekom said in a statement that the core functions of AutoLinQ include an online address book linked to the navigation system. Drivers can type in journey destinations on the computer at home or work before getting in the car, or via their mobile phone when out and about. As the vehicle is connected to Deutsche Telekom&rsquo;s mobile network, drivers can call up information that tells them where the car is parked, or check whether the sunroof is open and close it remotely using their phone.<br>
 <!--more-->According to the website of AutoLinQ, Continental plans to work with Android developers and automakers to certify a core set of applications. An <strong>AutoLinQ SDK</strong> is scheduled to be released already <strong>by the end of the first quarter this year</strong> &ndash; probably due to its closeness to the regular Android SDK.<br>
 <br>
In the <strong>second half of 2010</strong> Continental plans to demonstrate first applications and of course the new app store to automotive customers (yes another app store&hellip;).<strong></strong><br>

    <link href="http://pavingways.github.io/bolt-mobile-browser-to-include-widgets_1222.html"/>
    <updated>2010-02-04T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://pavingways.github.io/bolt-mobile-browser-to-include-widgets_1222</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.bitstream.com/">Bitstream</a>, the company behind the popular <strong><a href="http://boltbrowser.com/">BOLT mobile browser</a></strong>, has announced that version 1.7 of its browser will have the ability to run Web applications &ndash; known as <strong>widgets</strong>.<br></p>

<br>


<p>BOLT already supports Ajax, Javascript and other web-based languages. But the widgets will be installed directly into the BOLT browser and thus will load and execute faster. The BOLT widgets are written <strong>in standard <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/widgets/">W3C code</a></strong>. Users can access their widgets from within the browser via a new widget menu.<br></p>

<br>


<p>“As many of the recent mobile and wireless trade shows have demonstrated, mobile applications are part of the mainstream mobile experience,” said Sampo Kaasila, vice president of research and development at Bitstream. “However, the vast majority of phones in use today are ‘feature phones’ not smartphones. Unfortunately for the users of these billions of feature phones, it isn’t easy to find, install and run mobile applications. By adding Web apps to BOLT, Bitstream is not only improving the usability of our mobile browser, we are also making it possible for literally billions of people to partake in the mobile apps revolution.”<!--more--><br></p>

<br>


<p>According to Bitstream, more than 3.4 million BOLT accounts have been created since last year, and the browser delivers over 2.8 million pages each day.<br></p>

<br>


<p>The new version of Bolt will be launched at the <a href="http://www.mobileworldcongress.com/index.htm">Mobile World Congress</a> on <strong>February 15, 2010</strong>, and there will be a small set of beta widgets available at launch.<br>
