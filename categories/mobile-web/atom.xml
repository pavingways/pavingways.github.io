    <id>http://pavingways.github.io/html5-meetup-october-recap_1831</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Mostly out of completeness reasons here is a little recap of our October 7th HTML5 Meetup:<br>
 <br>
This time 3 out of the 7 total attendees were there for the first time, so we might actually grow this meetup one day. But it was good as it was and we had some quite interesting topics. I just want to mention them here quickly (as far as I can remember):<ul> <li>Book: <a href="http://books.alistapart.com/products/html5-for-web-designers">HTML5 for Web Designers</a></li>   <li><a href="http://hbbtv.org/">HbbTV</a> and why it might be interesting for web developers</li>   <li><a href="http://code.google.com/webfonts">Google Web Fonts</a> (thanks to <a href="http://www.sbtheke.de/">Sven</a>!)</li>  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003DZ1Y7M">Amazon Kindle</a> product presentation ;)</li>    <li><a href="http://github.com/madrobby/zepto">Zepto.js</a> &ndash; a minimalist JavaScript framework for mobile WebKit browsers</li> <li><a href="http://joapp.com/">Jo</a> &ndash; HTML5 Mobile App Framework</li>    <li><a href="http://github.com/madrobby/vapor.js">vapor.js</a> &ndash; very fast and fun JavaScript tool</li> <li><a href="http://unify.github.com/unify/">Unify</a> &ndash; JavaScript mobile application framework</li>   <li>CSS3 vs. Canvas animations (CSS3 wins)</li> <li>Dextrose AG acquisition by Zynga (both win, <a href="http://www.dextrose.com/">they&rsquo;re hiring</a>)</li> <li>(function(){}()) vs. (function(){})() (thanks <a href="http://www.wibben.de/">Björn</a>)</li></ul>It was a fun evening at <a href="http://www.cafebarbruecke.de/">Cafe Brücke</a> (their food is much better than their website). It was surprisingly full between 20:00 to 22:00, but quieter than our previous locations.<br>
 <br>
Thank you all for coming and see you next time!</p>

    <link href="http://pavingways.github.io/webinos-new-project-to-enable-cross-platform-apps_1822.html"/>
    <updated>2010-09-29T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://pavingways.github.io/webinos-new-project-to-enable-cross-platform-apps_1822</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="http://www.webinos.org"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1512" title="webinos logo" src="http://www.pavingways.com/wp-content/uploads/webinos1.png" alt="" width="150" height="48" /></a><a href="http://webinos.org/">Webinos</a></strong> is a pan-European initiative trying to build a &ldquo;<strong>Secure WebOS Application Delivery Environment</strong>&rdquo;. It aims to create an open source platform that will &ldquo;enable web applications and services to be used and shared consistently and securely over a broad spectrum of converged and connected devices, including mobile, PC, home media (TV) and in-car units&rdquo;.<br>
 <br>
The consortium is led by the <a href="http://www.fokus.fraunhofer.de/en/fokus/index.html">Frauenhofer Institute for Open Communication Systems</a> and has already <a href="http://webinos.org/members">22 partners</a> including W3C, Samsung, Sony Ericsson, Telefonica, docomo, Deutsche Telekom, BMW and the University of Oxford. It has received a €10m funding from the EU and will run over three years.<br>
 <strong>Will webinos solve the fragmentation problem?</strong><br>
 <br>
As many developers know there are a lot of different application platforms out there already (Android, iPhone, Symbian, Web &hellip; you name it). Fragmentation and porting applications are huge issues for developers and expensive in regards to development cost and time.<br>
 <br>
The new consortium wants to solve this problem by creating an open source, web-based platform that would allow the same application to run across a very wide variety of device types. The platform can be used on any handset regardless of the OEM or carrier. Basically a universal OS or runtime environment to write once, run anywhere.<br>
 <strong>A very ambitious goal! </strong>Especially considering that maximum compatibility usually comes in a <em>least common denominator</em> package.<br>
 <br>
For us this project first and foremost raises some questions:<ul>   <li>How do other projects like JIL/the <a href="http://www.pavingways.com/the-holy-wholesale-applications-community-wac_1225.html"><strong>Wholesale Applications Community</strong></a> (WAC) fit into the picture? They also aim to create open platforms for mobile apps and solve the fragmentation problem.</li>   <li>Is this gonna be a corporate-driven <a href="http://www.phonegap.com/">PhoneGap</a>?</li>   <li>Comparable to other approaches like <a href="http://www.mobileopenlaszlo.org">Mobile OpenLaszlo</a>?</li>   <li>Will HTML5 have a big part in this? (probably it will)</li> <li>How small will the least common denominator really be?</li> <li>No matter how web-based you are you need to deal with browser issues and fragmentation &ndash; how is this solved?</li>   <li>Are there too many cooks in the kitchen?</li>   <li>Where do Google, Apple and Nokia (and many others) fit into this?</li>  <li>Where are the developers? It is a tough task to convince developers to develop for your platform, no matter how great it might be. Other companies are already spending millions on this (some more successful than others).</li>   <li>Is someone of webinos going to present the project at the <a href="http://www.pavingways.com/mobile-unconference-coming-to-germany_1489.html">Mobile Unconference in November</a>?</li></ul><strong>What we think:</strong><br>
 <br>
A well funded project with a noble goal. Lots of players involved, many obstacles to take, many people to convince. The goal is very, very ambitious and the resulting platform will depend on making compromises. The Web is the platform of the future &ndash; this is another proof.<br>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As you might have seen we collect and <a href="http://www.pavingways.com/great-mobile-events-coming-up_1406.html">blog about many different events</a>.<br>
 <strong>This event is special, because we are helping to organize this one!</strong><br>
 <a href="http://www.mobileunconference.com/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1496" title="mobile_unconference" src="http://www.pavingways.com/wp-content/uploads/mobile_unconference1.png" alt="" width="413" height="198" /></a><br>
 <br>
The <a href="http://www.mobileunconference.com/">Mobile Unconference</a> is a one-day event, a bit like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp">BarCamp</a>, a bit like a conference, entrance free or very low (around 30 EUR). Our goal is to bring developers together in a very informal way and give those who want to share their story the possibility to take the microphone and do a presentation, so:<ul>    <li>anyone can come, as a speaker or just as a guest</li>   <li>sessions can be submitted before the conference</li>    <li>anyone can take the stage and can do a session at the event</li>    <li>there will be a schedule to sign up for a session during the event</li> <li>sessions can be anything: talks, workshops, discussion rounds, artistic performances ;)</li>    <li>product pitches are strictly forbidden</li> <li>cool stories about your experiences developing mobile applications or doing business in the mobile space are very welcome</li>  <li>networking is encouraged</li>   <li>there will be free food and drinks</li></ul>We went to the <a href="http://www.pavingways.com/mobile-unconference-rotterdam-recap_1354.html">Mobile Unconference in Rotterdam this May</a> and came back with the impression of a really cool event and many contacts to developers from the Netherlands &ndash; an overall great experience.<br>
 <br>
Now we joined forces with <a href="http://www.syntens.nl/">Syntens</a> and are bringing the <a href="http://www.mobileunconference.com">Mobile Unconference</a> to Germany. The event is targeted to take place in early November in Düsseldorf. The location allows us to invite attendees from Holland, we are even planning to hire a bus from Utrecht to Düsseldorf to make traveling simple and fun.<br>
 <br>
With this event we want to fuel innovation and cooperations between Dutch and German developers/companies and hopefully some more attendees will join in from Sweden and Denmark (we&rsquo;re working on this).<br>
 <br>
If you want to be a part in this, you can help us now! Specifically we need:<ul>    <li>attendees &ndash; can you make it to Düsseldorf in early November? Do you know anyone that might be interested in coming?</li>   <li>sessions &ndash; do you have an interesting story to tell, want to do a workshop?</li>    <li>location &ndash; we need a location, can you recommend anything in Düsseldorf?</li>  <li>sponsors &ndash; do you want to support us or know someone wo has some sponsoring budget?</li>    <li>news coverage &ndash; please tell anyone you know about this!</li></ul><div>If so, then please:</div><ul> <li><a href="http://twitter.com/pavingways/statuses/24962379968">Retweet this!</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.pavingways.com/contact">Get in touch with us!</a></li></ul><div>Thank you very much and hopefully we&rsquo;ll see you there!</div></p>
