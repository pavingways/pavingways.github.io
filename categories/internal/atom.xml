    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Happy 2014 and welcome to our new blog!</p>

<p>It has been very quiet around here for a while &ndash; <strong>over two years</strong> have passed since our last blog entry.
Now we&rsquo;re redefining, tightening and updating PavingWays and we made some changes to our blog too.</p>

<h2>New Blog</h2>

<p>We transferred the old pavingways.com from a self-hosted and heavily modified WordPress installation to a <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>/<a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> blog on <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>.
The page is additionally delivered through <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">CloudFlare</a> as we had CF set up before and it had proven to be reliable and fast.</p>

<p>The whole migration process went relatively smoothly however I had to make some adjustments here and there.</p>

<h3>Migrate old WordPress Posts to Markdown</h3>

<p>Before we settled with <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> I tried <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> and <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> directly, so it was clear I would need to have our old posts as Markdown files or HTML if everything else would fail.</p>

<p>So I wrote a PHP script that exported all of our old WordPress posts to Markdown files using an old PHP class called <a href="http://milianw.de/projects/markdownify/">Markdownify</a>.
Trouble was that this class needed way too many adjustments and I never was satisfied with the results, so I discarded wanting to have ALL posts in Markdown and decided to go with the <a href="http://import.jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll importer</a> which produces HTML files.
The process looked simple and roughly goes like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>export a WXR file from your WordPress &ldquo;Tools&rdquo; section</li>
<li>follow a few simple steps on the <a href="http://import.jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll importer page</a></li>
<li>have your old blog posts in _posts (as .html files)</li>
</ul>


<p>Guess what &hellip; this did not work and first I got this:</p>

<pre><code>$ jekyll import wordpress --source pavingways.wordpress.2014-01-05.xml

Could not require 'htmlentities', so the :clean_entities option is now disabled.
error: LoadError: cannot load such file -- mysql2. Use --trace to view backtrace
</code></pre>

<p>This is caused by some missing gems and you should &ldquo;gem install&rdquo; <code>htmlentities</code>, <code>sequel</code>, <code>mysql</code> and <code>mysql2</code> just to be sure.</p>

<p>Some more playing around with this revealed that apparently the command line suggested on the <a href="http://import.jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll importer page</a> is/was simply wrong <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-import/issues/119">see my bug report</a>:
The importer consists of several sub-importers for various systems and for wordpress there are two &ndash; one for self-hosted blogs and one for blogs on wordpress.com.</p>

<p>I had no local DB of my old blog at hand &ndash; unfortunately the wordpress importer requires one in contrast to above command line example. That was initially not clear to me and I already had my WXR file &hellip;<br/>
And so I went with the <code>wordpressdotcom</code> importer, also because I found a <a href="http://hadihariri.com/2013/12/24/migrating-from-wordpress-to-jekyll/">blog post</a> on the matter and tried another command line (also contained in the <a href="http://import.jekyllrb.com/docs/wordpressdotcom/">Jekyll importer docs</a>) which works:</p>

<pre><code>$ruby -rubygems -e 'require "jekyll-import"; JekyllImport::Importers::WordpressDotCom.run({ "source" =&gt; "pavingways.wordpress.2014-01-05.xml" })'
</code></pre>

<p>Basically I could also have done this and had saved some time, oh well:</p>

<pre><code>$ jekyll import wordpressdotcom --source pavingways.wordpress.2014-01-05.xml
</code></pre>

<p>Now I had all my files in <em>_posts</em> as I wanted. My remaining issues with the wordpressdotcom importer were as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>filenames did not match my old URL scheme <code>/{post_name}_{ID}.html</code> .</li>
<li>files do not contain a <code>date</code> field in their head section</li>
<li>files do not contain a <code>comments</code> field in their head section</li>
<li>HTML in WordPress is apparently outputted using PHP&rsquo;s <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.nl2br.php">nl2br()</a> function, so the HTML files did not contain the necessary <code>&lt;br&gt;</code>s</li>
</ul>


<p>In my first stab at Ruby source code ever since I read <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/rails1/agile-web-development-with-rails">this Rails book</a> in 2005 I changed the jekyll-import Gem (the file is called <code>wordpressdotcom.rb</code>) so it did all of the above and finally I was happy with my old post files.</p>

<p>Some changes to the default Octopress theme and (S)CSS I had a working site and especially all of our old blog posts on GitHub.</p>

<h3>Hosted Comments and Migration</h3>

<p>The same WXR file I used for importing our old post can be used to import all comments to <a href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a>. Details see <a href="http://hadihariri.com/2013/12/24/migrating-from-wordpress-to-jekyll/">this blog post</a> again.
The import worked alright, however I did not see any comments in the Disqus box below our posts.</p>

<p>Apparently Disqus and CloudFlare don&rsquo;t just work together as planned and so I followed <a href="http://www.elizaibeth.com/disqus-comments-not-showing-correctly/">this post</a> and It worked &ndash; unfortunately only partly&hellip;</p>

<p>As it turns out I had to do a <em>domain migration</em> in Disqus (Discussions &ndash;> Tools) in order to see all my old comments.
Strangely this required me to migrate from my (unchanged) domain <code>pavingways.com</code> to <code>pavingways.github.io</code> so they now appear in Disqus like this:</p>

<pre><code>http://pavingways.github.io/new-year-new-blog.html
</code></pre>

<p>I had no time digging deeper but apparetly disqus realizes that my page is hosted on GitHub.
Finally all comments show up and we have a working blog again.</p>

<p>Octopress' rake commands make it now simple and easy to write/debug posts and deploy them to GitHub.</p>

<p><strong>Happy New Year!</strong></p>
