    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Some more interesting news announced at the Mobile Word Congress:<ul>   <li><strong>Google&rsquo;s new strategy &ldquo;Mobile First&rdquo;</strong><br>
Google&rsquo;s new strategy: &ldquo;Mobile First&rdquo;  The company now focuses more on smartphones than on desktops. That means giving mobile top priority and launching new products first on mobile platforms before creating PC versions.<br>
 <br>
(Source: <a href="http://www.brighthand.com/default.asp?newsID=16235&amp;news=Google+Android+OS+CEO+Eric+Schmidt+Mobile+First">brighthand.com</a>)</li></ul><ul>    <li><strong>60,000 Android phone a day</strong><br>
Google&rsquo;s Android launched a year ago and is now available on <strong>26 different devices in 48 countries</strong>. <strong>60.000 Android devices</strong> running this operating systems are now <strong>being sold on a daily basis</strong>  meaning about<strong> 5.4 million</strong> handsets per quarter, or <strong>21 million</strong> per year. <a href="http://www.pavingways.com/smart-phone-sales-up-30-in-q4-2009_1174.html">Apple sold 8.7 million iPhones last quarter and 25 million in 2009</a>. Seems like Android is gaining ground, hopefully internal fragmentation will be taken care of (if that&rsquo;s possible).<br>

 <!--more--></li></ul><ul>  <li><strong>Windows Marketplace for Mobile has been updated</strong><br>
Windows Marketplace for Mobile, Microsoft&rsquo;s application store, has been updated. The biggest change is there will <strong>no</strong> longer be <strong>regional limitations</strong> on where apps are sold. This is great news for non-US customers because they could only see localized apps and the selection was very limited. Now thanks to the &ldquo;geo selector&rdquo; users can browse and purchase applications from different geographic catalogs / countries. The price of each app will show up in the <strong>user&rsquo;s local currency</strong>. Besides users can install downloaded apps onto their <strong>storage cards</strong>.<br>
 <br>
Developers also <strong>do not have to pay a US$10 fee </strong>for submitting their apps to additional markets anymore &ndash; only the US$ 99 submission fee has to be paid. <strong>VOIP apps</strong> will now be allowed unless a carrier specifically prohibits it. Microsoft now also opens its marketplace to <strong>Russia</strong>.<br>
 <br>
BTW Mobilegamesblog.com published some first screenshots of Windows Marketplace for the Windows Phone 7 Series devices. There is no real source named for these images, so they should be considered as a rumor: <a href="http://blog.mobilegamesblog.com/2010/02/first-screens-windows-phone-7-marketplace.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+MobileGamesBlog+%28Mobile+Games+Blog.com%29">mobilegamesblog.com</a><br>

Handset maker Alcatel unveiled a number of new handsets at Mobile World Congress and interestingly its first Android-based phone OT-980. The phone will be available around June for less than 200 EUR in the UK, France, Spain and Italy. But they are still considering using other platforms, such as Windows Mobile, if prices come down.<br>

China Unicom plans to launch low-cost 3G smartphones &ndash; maybe in collaboration with Huawei which has also recognized that smartphones remain too expensive. Key to unlocking the potential usage of 3G is the need for a $150 smartphone with iPhone-like capabilities , said Guo Ping, CSO, Huawei Technologies and chairman of Huawei devices.<br>

Deutsche Telekom plans to further integrate with mobile apps and content stores. By partnering with leading applications stores Deutsche Telekom wants to offer its customers a T-Mobile dedicated channel with specific recommendations and the opportunity for mobile phone billing (instead of credit card payment).<br>
Deutsche Telekom&rsquo;s open mobile internet strategy implies that customers ultimately get access to a wide choice of all available applications, regardless of their mobile phone brand. As a basis we provide easy log-in, registration, and payment processes, as well as Deutsche Telekom channels in existing stores and customer oriented recommendations,&ldquo; states Rainer Deutschmann, Senior Vice President Mobile Products.<br>

    <link href="http://pavingways.github.io/bolt-mobile-browser-to-include-widgets_1222.html"/>
    <updated>2010-02-04T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://pavingways.github.io/bolt-mobile-browser-to-include-widgets_1222</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.bitstream.com/">Bitstream</a>, the company behind the popular <strong><a href="http://boltbrowser.com/">BOLT mobile browser</a></strong>, has announced that version 1.7 of its browser will have the ability to run Web applications &ndash; known as <strong>widgets</strong>.<br></p>

<br>


<p>BOLT already supports Ajax, Javascript and other web-based languages. But the widgets will be installed directly into the BOLT browser and thus will load and execute faster. The BOLT widgets are written <strong>in standard <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/widgets/">W3C code</a></strong>. Users can access their widgets from within the browser via a new widget menu.<br></p>

<br>


<p>“As many of the recent mobile and wireless trade shows have demonstrated, mobile applications are part of the mainstream mobile experience,” said Sampo Kaasila, vice president of research and development at Bitstream. “However, the vast majority of phones in use today are ‘feature phones’ not smartphones. Unfortunately for the users of these billions of feature phones, it isn’t easy to find, install and run mobile applications. By adding Web apps to BOLT, Bitstream is not only improving the usability of our mobile browser, we are also making it possible for literally billions of people to partake in the mobile apps revolution.”<!--more--><br></p>

<br>


<p>According to Bitstream, more than 3.4 million BOLT accounts have been created since last year, and the browser delivers over 2.8 million pages each day.<br></p>

<br>


<p>The new version of Bolt will be launched at the <a href="http://www.mobileworldcongress.com/index.htm">Mobile World Congress</a> on <strong>February 15, 2010</strong>, and there will be a small set of beta widgets available at launch.<br>

    <link href="http://pavingways.github.io/mobile-monday-frankfurt-mobile-internet-and-applications_366.html"/>
    <updated>2009-04-22T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://pavingways.github.io/mobile-monday-frankfurt-mobile-internet-and-applications_366</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday we attended the <a href="http://www.mobile-monday.de/events/mobile-internet-and">Mobile Monday in Frankfurt</a>. The topic was <strong>Mobile Internet and Applications</strong>. <a href="http://www.forum.nokia.com/">Forum Nokia</a> was one of the sponsors of this event. For us it was a good accommodation for the upcoming <a href="http://www.pavingways.com/attending-nokia-developer-summit-2009_293.html">Nokia Developer Summit</a> next week in Monaco.<br></p>

<br>


<p>The first presentation was held by Jarkko Tolvi from Forum Nokia. He introduced <a href="http://www.forum.nokia.com/">Forum Nokia</a>, an important platform for developers of mobile services. Forum Nokia offers them a wide range of resources to help them design, build, test, certify, market, and sell or promote their applications, content, services, or Web site to mobile users. It&rsquo;s the worlds biggest mobile developer community with over 4 million members.<br></p>

<br>


<p>Arnaud Caigniet from <a href="http://www.opera.com/">Opera</a> was next. The topic of his talk was &ldquo;What can the industry do to see &lsquo;One Web&rsquo; everywhere?&rdquo;. With <a href="http://www.pavingways.com/state-of-the-mobile-web-2009-mobile-web-is-booming-in-developing-countries_276.html">statistics</a> Arnaud showed that the mobile usage has grown and the growth still continues. The most growth in mobile usage Opera sees in Indonesia, China, Russia and India.<br></p>

<!--more-->


<p>&ldquo;To Opera, One Web means being able to take the one true Web and make it available to people on their own terms.&rdquo; (source: <a href="http://www.opera.com/business/oneweb/">opera.com</a>) Nowadays, people can access the web not only on their Desktop PCs or mobile phones, but also on TVs, gaming consoles, digital frames etc. Arnaud pointed out that the technology is here and <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/">Web standards</a> (e.g. CSS) are defined and are very important (we couldn&rsquo;t agree more). With these fundamentals people should be able to access the same familiar Web content seamlessly on any device. How to make that possible?<ol>   <li><strong>support open standards</strong></li>    <li><strong>graceful degradation</strong> (&ldquo;It means that, when you put in features designed to take advantage of the latest and greatest features of newer browsers, you should do it in a way that older browsers, and browsers letting users disable particular features, can "step down&rdquo; to a method that still allows access to the basic content of the site, though perhaps not as snazzy in appearance.&ldquo; Source: <a href="http://webtips.dan.info/graceful.html">webtips.dan.info</a>)</li> <li><strong>optimization</strong> (e.g. phone numbers as link if it&rsquo;s a capable device)</li></ol><br>
Arnaud also introduced some of Opera&rsquo;s services/features, such as:<ul>  <li><a href="http://www.opera.com/business/solutions/turbo/">Opera Turbo</a>, a cross-platform compression solution to speed up data transfer and to reduce the amount of data that needs to be downloaded</li> <li><a href="http://link.opera.com/">Opera Link</a> for synchronizing bookmarks, notes or any other data between Desktop computers and mobile phones</li>   <li><a href="http://labs.opera.com/news/2009/03/05/">Opera Fingertouch</a>, a technology designed to make interacting with the Web easier and simpler on touch-based devices</li>   <li><a href="http://www.opera.com/mini/features/">virtual mouse:</a> Opera Mini gives your phone a virtual mouse, so you can easily scroll in any direction.</li>   <li><a href="http://www.opera.com/mini/features/">power scrolling</a><a href="http://www.opera.com/mini/features/"> shortcuts</a>: mobile browsing by using Phone&rsquo;s number keys, e.g. press 2 to go up</li> <li>screen rotation between landscape and portrait mode (like the iPhone), accelerometers are supported</li></ul><br>
An interesting fact is that in Russia Opera Mini has a market share of 30-35%, probably most of the users there have "old&rdquo; mobile phones and Opera Mini enables them to surf the web easier and more comfortable than with their pre-installed web browser. In Germany the <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">iPhone</a> is market leader.<br></p>

<br>


<p>The last presentation was held by Christian Schepke from Nokia about &ldquo;<a href="http://www.ovi.com/services/">Nokia Ovi</a>: Content Strategy of the Nokia Ovi store&rdquo;. With Ovi, meaning &lsquo;door&rsquo; in Fininish, Nokia offers a range of different Internet services, such as <a href="http://www.ovi.com/services/discover/maps?lang=en">Maps, Mail, File Sharing etc.</a>, under one umbrella. The Ovi store, Nokia&rsquo;s global application market, is based on 2 components:<ol> <li><strong>location</strong> (getting relevant content based on your location)</li>    <li><strong>people</strong> (getting relevant content based on your social network, e.g. all of your friends downloaded a special application, that might be also an interesting app for you)</li></ol><br>
With this service Nokia wants to offer relevant content to the users and wants to give developers a better opportunity to reach their target audience with their application/service. Users can also rate and comment on these third-party applications which offers developers another way for getting feedback from the community.<br></p>

<br>


<p>The launch date of the Ovi store is scheduled in May 2009. Through <a href="http://www.publish.ovi.com">www.publish.ovi.com</a> developers get a self-service publishing tool to distribute and monetize their applications and content to consumers using Nokia devices. The revenue share is <a href="https://publish.ovi.com/login">70/30</a> after carrier charges have been deducted.<br></p>

<br>


<p>Nokia plans to reach 300 mio. users by 2012 worldwide.<br></p>

<br>


<p>After the presentations the networking part started. The opinions about the Ovi Store were quite positive, but there were also some skeptical ones. Basically, Ovi store is the right step in the right direction. Its success will probably depend on its implementation and if all those services are seamlessly integrated into each other. I am very excited about the upcoming <a href="http://www.developersummit2009.com/">Developer Summit</a> next week and I am already a fan of <a href="http://2009.nseries.com/specs.aspx">Nokia&rsquo;s N97</a>. It is nice to see that new mobile devices are increasingly becoming full-fledged web devices as well and that we can already develop and deploy applications based on web standards to them.<br>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We&rsquo;ll be going to Monaco by the end of April to attend the <a href="http://www.developersummit2009.com/"><strong>Nokia Developer Summit 2009</strong></a>.<a href="http://2009.nseries.com/specs.aspx"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-295" title="nokia_n97" src="http://www.pavingways.com/wp-content/uploads/nokia_n971.jpg" alt="" width="207" height="157" /></a><br></p>

<br>


<p>During this summit <strong>in Monte Carlo on 28-29 April</strong>, Nokia is holding a <a href="http://2009.nseries.com/competition/about.aspx">&ldquo;<strong>N97 24-hour Hackathon</strong>&rdquo; competition</a>. I am one of 10 developers selected by <a href="http://www.forum.nokia.com/">Forum Nokia</a> who is gonna hack together a Web Runtime (WRT) widget for the home screen of the <a href="http://2009.nseries.com/specs.aspx">new Nokia N97</a>.<br></p>

<br>


<p>The Hackathon session will be streamed live and I will be in action 24h competing face-to-face with the other developers. At the end of this Hackathon, <a href="http://2009.nseries.com/competition/top-10.aspx">all widgets</a> will be judged by a panel of experts from Nokia Forum &amp; Nokia&rsquo;s N97 team. The winning designer will get a Nokia N97 pre-loaded with the app. Also, the next to cash prizes, &ldquo;[&hellip;]The winning widget will also be awarded premium spotlight status on the main page of the new Nokia Ovi Store, which is opening in May. It will be free to download in Australia, Germany, Italy, Ireland, Russia, Singapore, Spain, United Kingdom, and United States. The apps which come second and third at the Hackathon judging panel will also get spotlight placement on the sight.[&hellip;]&rdquo; (Source: <a href="http://2009.nseries.com/competition/about.aspx">Nokia</a>).<br></p>

<br>


<p>Nokia is going through quite some replacements on the widget and content distribution front these days: Their WRT Widgets will replace formerly well received WidSets and maybe other apps too, and Nokia&rsquo;s new <a href="http://www.ovi.com/services/">Ovi store</a> will replace their current offering called Mosh.<br></p>

<br>


<p>I am really looking forward to the event &ndash; not just because I can spend some exciting days in Monte Carlo :), but also because it&rsquo;s a great opportunity to get in touch with many people in the mobile and mobile web area since a long time.<br>

    <link href="http://pavingways.github.io/state-of-the-mobile-web-2009-mobile-web-is-booming-in-developing-countries_276.html"/>
    <updated>2009-03-01T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://pavingways.github.io/state-of-the-mobile-web-2009-mobile-web-is-booming-in-developing-countries_276</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently, <a href="http://www.opera.com/">Opera</a> released its new <a href="http://www.opera.com/smw/2009/01/"><strong>&ldquo;State of the Mobile Web 2009&rdquo;</strong></a> report and revealed that they had one of their largest monthly increases ever in January 2009. Opera Mini now has <strong>more than 20 million users</strong>. Those users viewed approximately <strong>7.6 billion pages in January</strong>. Page views and data transfers increased <strong>18% month-over-month</strong>. That means, not only more people are using the mobile web, but they also use it more often.<br></p>

<br>


<p>The mobile Web usage is booming in developing countries. Among the top 35 countries using the browser, Armenia, Nigeria and Egypt showed the most growth between January 2008 and January 2009 in terms of unique users. The most significant growth (2800%) was in Armenia (a country with 3 million residents). On average Armenians surfed 669 pages per user in January and that is far more than it is in other countries.<br></p>

<br>


<p>&ldquo;Looking back on a full year of mobile Web growth, it is easy to see why mobile devices will become the primary device for Web usage in most of the world,&rdquo; said Jon von Tetzchner, Opera&rsquo;s CEO, in a statement. &ldquo;Developing countries may lead the way due to the sheer prevalence of mobile devices versus PCs, but the solid growth rates in developed countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom and Germany, show the entire world is moving in this direction.&rdquo;<br></p>
