    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I came across an interesting report from <a href="http://www.i-nigma.com/pr26.html">3GVision</a>, the creator of the <a href="http://www.i-nigma.com/i-nigmahp.html">i-nigma barcode scanner</a>. The numbers show a worldwide growth in mobile barcode usage. The US is leading the growth, but the popularity of barcodes is also increasing in Europe with Germany, the UK and Italy leading this trend. So maybe this is finally catching up outside of Japan?<br>
<strong>Top 10 users of mobile barcodes during May 2011:</strong><p style="padding-left: 30px;">(1)   1. United States<br>

* see below for notes on reporting methodology<h3>QR-Codes and Marketing</h3><br>
As mentioned in the report the mobile barcode usage is increasing in Germany. On <a href="http://www.mobilemarketingwelt.com/2011/06/30/top-5-mobile-marketing-kampagnen-juni-2011/">mobilemarketingwelt.com</a> I found some interesting mobile marketing campaigns using QR codes (&ldquo;Quick Response Codes&rdquo;). Here are some examples how companies already using QR-Codes in their advertisment.<br>
<strong>1. Bausch + Lomb &ndash; QR-Code, SMS, Mobile Couponing</strong><br></p>

<br>


<p>The pharmaceutical company Bausch+Lomb uses QR-Codes and SMS shortcode in his <a href="http://www.mobilemarketingwelt.com/2011/06/24/bauschlomb-nutzt-mobile-couponing/">print ads</a>. By scanning the QR code the user will be forwarded to a mobile landing page where he receives more information about Biotrue, a care product for contact lenses. He also gets a coupon there for a free product sample.<br>
In case the user has no QR-Code reader on his mobile phone he can request a link to the mobile portal via SMS shortcode.<br>
<a href="http://www.pavingways.com/wp-content/uploads/Bausch+Lomb_QR-Code.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2340" title="Bausch+Lomb_QR-Code" src="http://www.pavingways.com/wp-content/uploads/Bausch+Lomb_QR-Code-82x300.jpg" alt="" width="82" height="300" /></a><br>
<strong>2. Globetrotter – QR-Codes</strong><br></p>

<br>


<p>The equipment manufacturer Globetrotter used QR-Codes <a href="http://www.mobilemarketingwelt.com/2011/06/06/globetrotter-setzt-auf-qr-codes-2/">in his latest print campaign</a>. By scanning the QR code on the advertisement the user will get to a mobile landing page where he receives more information about the reforestation project &ldquo;Globetrotter VisionsWald&rdquo;.<br>
<a href="http://www.pavingways.com/wp-content/uploads/Globetrotter_QR-Code4.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2337" title="Globetrotter_QR-Code4" src="http://www.pavingways.com/wp-content/uploads/Globetrotter_QR-Code4-218x300.jpg" alt="" width="218" height="300" /></a> <a href="http://www.pavingways.com/wp-content/uploads/Globetrotter_Mobile-Portal.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2338" title="Globetrotter_Mobile-Portal" src="http://www.pavingways.com/wp-content/uploads/Globetrotter_Mobile-Portal-250x300.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="300" /></a><br>
<strong>3. Universal Music – image recognition</strong><br></p>

<br>


<p>In his latest <a href="http://www.mobilemarketingwelt.com/2011/06/22/universal-music-bewirbt-lady-gaga-album-mit-u-snap-plakatkampagne/">poster advertising campaign</a> for the new Lady Gaga Album Universal Music uses the <a href="http://www.wall.de/en/press/news/walldecaux_launcht_u_snap_in_deutschland">U snap App from Wall AG</a>, a value-added app for smartphones, on the German market. The user has to download the free U snap App for iPhone or Android smartphones from the App Store. When starting the app the user can take a picture of the print ad and gets samples from the new Lady Gaga album, can view music videos or win concert tickets, fan packages and CDs.<br>
About 15,000 City Light Posters with the slogan &ldquo;Fly to Lady Gaga with U snap&rdquo; accompany the release of the new album &ldquo;Born This Way&rdquo;.<br>
<a href="http://www.pavingways.com/wp-content/uploads/U-snap_Lady-Gaga.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2358" title="U-snap_Lady-Gaga" src="http://www.pavingways.com/wp-content/uploads/U-snap_Lady-Gaga-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a><h3>Our Opinion:</h3><br>
Many brands and retailers already started using QR-Codes in their marketing campaigns. For example <a href="http://mobile-tagging.blogspot.com/2011/07/mein-burger-von-mcdonalds-mit-qr-codes.html">McDonalds</a>, <a href="http://mobile-tagging.blogspot.com/2011/03/vichy-mit-qr-code-branding.html">Vichy</a>, <a href="http://mobile-tagging.blogspot.com/2011/02/extended-packaging-frischfleisch-bei.html">Aldi Süd</a>, <a href="http://www.tagmotion.de/2011/06/28/qr-code-supermarkt/">Tesco</a> etc. The biggest advantage of QR-Codes is that customers get further information about a product fast and easy. They just need a mobile phone with a camera, web access and a QR-Code reader software (e.g. <a href="http://reader.kaywa.com/">Kaywa Reader</a>, <a href="http://www.quickmark.com.tw/En/basic/download.asp">QuickMark Barcode Reader</a>, <a href="http://www.i-nigma.com/Downloadi-nigmaReader.html">i-nigma Reader</a>).<br></p>

<br>


<p>There are various opportunities of using QR-Codes. Companies can use them as a direct response marketing tool for print campaigns (call-to-action) or even to sell virtual goods like games, music or ringtones. I think the usage of QR Codes will be increasing in the future and we will see a wide range of usage of QR-Codes in marketing.<br>

<strong>* Notes on reporting methodology:</strong><ul>  <li>These reports are based on the total number of QRcode, Datamatrix and UPC/EAN scans recorded by the i-nigma system during the relevant periods. Because of i‑nigma’s prominence in many markets worldwide, 3GVision believes that these numbers are likely to be indicative of global mobile barcode activity.</li> <li>The reports do not include activity in Japan, which is known to be well ahead in popularity and usage of mobile barcodes.</li>  <li>For better representation of global open market trends, the reports specifically exclude the activity of i‑nigma-based solutions that are used by our vertical customers.</li>    <li>Top 5 growing countries are from the top 20 countries in mobile barcodes usage during May/2011.</li></ul><br>

    <updated>2011-03-30T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://pavingways.github.io/mobile-apps-building-deployment-jsugfra1_2221</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This Monday we held the second iteration of our JavaScript User Group here in Frankfurt: <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search/%23jsugfra">#jsugfra</a> (thanks <a href="http://twitter.com/bjoernwibben">Björn</a>!)<br></p>

<br>


<p>There were only around 12 attendees there, although signups ranged around 20 &ndash; so shame on you if you didn&rsquo;t show up! ;)<br></p>

<br>


<p>But it&rsquo;s your loss, because aside from <a href="http://twitter.com/EugeneTerehov">Evgenij</a>&lsquo;s <a href="http://bit.ly/hstyMP">talk</a> you missed my &ldquo;little&rdquo; (1hr) hands-on session showing how you can deploy the same JS-based app &ndash; build upon <a href="http://unify.github.com/unify/">Unify</a> &ndash; to several platforms, namely those:<ul>   <li>the browser,</li>   <li>homescreen (appcache on iOS) &ndash; this is different from the browser,</li> <li>iOS (iPhone and iPad with PhoneGap),</li>   <li>Android (PhoneGap too),</li>    <li>BlackBerry PlayBook (WebWorks on TabletOS),</li>    <li>Samsung Bada (JS-App-Package),</li> <li>WAC (sort of),</li> <li>and Samsung Internet@TV</li></ul><br>
Unify makes this easy in many regards (JS-build process, appcache context detection etc.). My goal was to show the difficulties and differences in SDKs and build/deployment tools &ndash; this became pretty clear I think, especially talking about the difficulties. The main message I wanted to bring across this evening was:<br>
<strong>If you want people to write apps for your platform, then given them some decent development tools!</strong><br></p>

<br>


<p>This means preferably CLI build/deploy tools (helps with automating builds) and a well working Simulator/Emulator plus simple device deployments. If you consider these points and look at the app numbers in different stores you see what I mean:<ul> <li>Apple got this one right (Xcode and iOS Simulator just work, simple device deployments),</li>   <li>Android is behind in this (Eclipse and especially the Emulator is unusably slow, device deployment easy),</li>  <li>Blackberry is not bad (CLI tools, fast Emulator, simple deployment to devices),</li>    <li>Samsung does a separate thing for different platforms and both are Eclipse-based (only Windows! WTF?, Emulators work well tho)</li> <li>WAC uses the Android Emulator (cf. above) with a Widget Runtime on it and an Eclipse-based SDK (translation: slow)</li></ul><br>
Bottom line is: Many Edit-&gt;Build-&gt;Deployment chains are just so unbearably slow and/or unusable that it takes all the fun out of coding for these platforms. If you add the Appstore&trade;-submission overhead to the calculation, pure development work becomes a much smaller part in the total effort.<br>
<a href="http://twitter.com/fastner">Sebastian</a> also wrote <a href="http://tumblr.com/x4g1x6el9f">in detail about the JSUG meeting itself</a> &ndash; thanks for that!<br>
Looking forward to jsugfra[2]</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>March 28th will see the 2nd JavaScript User Group meeting in Frankfurt (JSUGFRA). I will do a little talk about different SDKs that enable you to bring your JavaScript application to many different platforms and devices, not in the browser but as an (almost) native app.<br></p>

<br>


<p>iOS, Android, Nokia, BlackBerry, HP/Palm and even Samsung TVs will be covered. I&rsquo;ll try to do this as a hands-on demo actually putting a simple JS-powered app onto some devices/emulators.<br></p>

<br>


<p>Here&rsquo;s the flyer:<br>

<br>


<p>It&rsquo;s #1 because it started with #0 I suppose&hellip;<br></p>

    <link href="http://pavingways.github.io/wholesale-applications-community-wac-goes-live_2157.html"/>
    <updated>2011-02-17T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://pavingways.github.io/wholesale-applications-community-wac-goes-live_2157</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.pavingways.com/the-holy-wholesale-applications-community-wac_1549.html">Back at 2010&rsquo;s MWC</a> a number of leading telco companies announced the formation of an international alliances called &ldquo;<a href="http://www.wacapps.net/">Wholesale Applications Community</a>&rdquo; (WAC). Not a lot was heard since then until this year&rsquo;s MWC (2011):<h3>WAC launches its first products</h3><a href="http://www.wacapps.net/">WAC</a> has announced its commercial launch with over 69 member companies already. The goal is to build a standardized platform for mobile widgets and apps based on W3C standards. Developers can deploy an app across multiple devices and operators. That means they can publish their apps to a &ldquo;warehouse&rdquo; and then an operator chooses the apps it needs. The developer doesn&rsquo;t have to care about delivering his apps to each operator separately, this makes WAC effectively the man in the middle.<br></p>

<br>


<p>&ldquo;With the commercial launch of operator storefronts, handsets and applications, all based on WAC, we can say that WAC is now officially open for business,&rdquo; Peters Suh, chief executive of WAC, said in a statement.<br></p>

<br>


<p>Eight major operators, such as Vodafone, China Mobile, Orange or Verizon, have announced they are now connected to the WAC platform and started to connect their app stores to the WAC marketplace, so that developers can reach a huge number of potential customers by uploading their apps to the WAC store. Vodafone already made many of their apps WAC compatible. There are currently more than 12,000 apps available via WAC in total.<!--more--><br></p>

<br>


<p>Also device manufacturers such as Huawei, LG, Samsung, Sony Ericsson and ZTE support the WAC. Especially LG and Samsung announced that their devices, which are powerful enough will support the WAC runtime. Huawei unveiled its first WAC-enabled mobile phone and Ericsson a white-label storefront that others can customize and use as their own app store. <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/33682.wss">IBM</a> also introduced a storefront that provides access all of the currently available WAC apps &ndash; also available as white-label for operators.<br></p>

<br>


<p>So how does a WAC app look like?<h3>WAC sticks to web standards &amp; HTML5</h3><br>
WAC applications basically are local, web-technology based applications (<a href="http://www.pavingways.com/development">our specialty</a>) wrapped into a ZIP package. W3C widgets have largely been the base for the spec. The WAC standard encompasses definitions about application structure, packaging format and such.<br></p>

<br>


<p>The WAC stores and apps that already have been launched are based on WAC 1.0. This week WAC has launched the WAC 2.0 specifications, which supports HTML5. The WAC 3.0 release is scheduled for September 2011 and will contain in-app billing support and user identification.<h3>Should you care about WAC?</h3><br>
The initiative shows that widgets and other apps based on web technology and web standards are becoming a real business. The WAC existence and support from many big players show that cross-platform compatibility and overcoming app store fragmentation are important topics.<br></p>

<br>


<p>For developers the WAC surely is a great service as it allows you to submit your app once and potentially have it listed in several app stores automatically.<h3>Do you need to care about creating a WAC app?</h3><br>
As soon as you realize Apple&rsquo;s iTunes Appstore and even the Android Market are not your only target, you should care about WAC. If you developed your application using web technology already then you should be able to port it to the WAC spec with low effort. If not it might be harder, but many native applications can be created using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript already.<br></p>

<br>


<p>In any case <a href="#contact">please talk to us</a> &ndash; we can tell you how to do it!<br>
