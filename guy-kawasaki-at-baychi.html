<div class="entry-content">Last Tuesday we went to a <a href="http://www.baychi.org">BayCHI meeting</a> in Palo Alto to hear <a href="www.guykawasaki.com">Guy Kawasaki&#8217;s</a> presentation about &#8221;<a href="http://www.baychi.org/calendar/20070814/"><strong>How I built a Web 2.0, User-Generated Content, Citizen Journalism, Long-Tail, Social Media Site for $12,107.09</strong></a>&#8221; (Yes, tongue in cheek here).

First of all Guy Kawasaki is a great presenter - we really enjoyed his presentation. He has the right mix between presenting and entertaining :)

<strong>So, what was this headline filled with so many buzzwords all about? </strong>
In his talk Guy introduced his new startup <a href="http://www.truemors.com"><strong>Truemors</strong></a>. Well, at the first look you may think &#8220;What&#8217;s the point of this site?&#8221;. To be honest, when I saw Truemors a couple of days before the event, I was also a bit confused and did not really see the value of this website. But after that event I changed my mind&#8230;

<!--more-->Guy&#8217;s presentation was mostly about showing how Truemors works and what his intention was to found this company: <a href="http://truemors.com/about">It is all about democratization of information - access for everyone to everything</a>. He also talked about <a href="http://alwayson.goingon.com/permalink/post/14481">how the 12,107.09 USD came together</a>. For me it is a user-generated news site, where you can find interesting and very diverse news - quite different from the normal newspaper stories or the yellow press - and that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s much more interesting.

As a use case Guy mentioned this: imagine that you wanna go on a date, but you don&#8217;t know what to talk about. So, check out Truemors first and there you are. A good way to impress your date with your broad knowledge. (I actually use it when I&#8217;m bored or need a break from my work.)

All in all I like this idea/concept and the user base is growing as I can see. I hope there will be more and more international news, too. It would be really exciting to read what&#8217;s going on in China, New Zealand or India at this time right now.

<strong>I also would like to add some statements Guy made during his talk:</strong>
<ul>
	<li> &#8220;If you read Truemors every day, you will be a more interesting person.&#8221;</li>
	<li> &#8220;Life is good for entrepreneurs these days.&#8221;</li>
	<li> &#8220;12.000 USD goes a very long way these days.&#8221;</li>
	<li> &#8220;You can work with <a href="http://electricpulp.com/">a team that is thousands of miles away</a>.&#8221;</li>
	<li> &#8220;The blogosphere is full of angry people.&#8221;</li>
	<li> &#8220;I <strike>spend</strike> spent about 3 to 4 hours deleting posts containing &#8216;vagi*a&#8217; every day.&#8221; (bummer)</li>
	<li> &#8220;My second round of raising capital will be another presentation.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
And did I mentioned The Inquirer called Truemors the &#8221;<a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=39708">worst website ever</a>&#8221;? Oh and it&#8217;s based on <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a> (it can&#8217;t be so bad then).

As a mobile oriented person I would love to see a mobile version. Because when you meet someone e.g. at a conferene and you are running out of topics, wouldn&#8217;t it be cool to check Truemors through your mobile and look up for special topics quickly?

One thing that we would like to know more about: running costs. While we learned that the site costs roughly <strike>1500</strike> 150 USD a month for hosting, however we came to think about what the real costs of the employed services such as <a href="http://spinvox.com/">SpinVox</a> (for leaving a voice message that gets transcribed automatically) or <a href="http://golivemobile.com/">GoLive! Mobile</a> (for sending inbound SMS/text messages to the site) add up to - maybe Guy reads this (he seems to follow blogs closely) and can elaborate on that?

We also had a nice and informative talk with Awais from KPMG prior to Guy&#8217;s presentation. We talked about the <a href="http://alwayson.goingon.com/permalink/post/15899">AO 100 List</a>, a top list for start-ups that is compiled once a year by KPMG and <a href="http://alwayson.com/">AlwaysOn</a>. as well as the <a href="http://churchillclub.com/">Churcill Club</a>.
